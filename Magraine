Stroke-Transient Cerebral Ischaemic Attacks (TIAs) A Medical Emergency-Preventable and Treatable.
Dalal P, Bhattacharjee M.
Abstract

TIA is a serious condition and a medical emergency requiring immediate evaluation and treatment to prevent a stroke. Confirmation of diagnosis is vital. Medical conditions like hypoglycaemia, migraine etc which mimic TIA should be identified. TIA syndrome in carotid territory needs special evaluation by Duplex sonography to detect significant stenosis (>70%) near bifurcation. Recurrent TIA in the same territory leaves neuro deficit and this needs prevention by appropriate therapy (platelet antiaggregants, anticoagulants, surgical intervention). An algorithm listing initial workup for TIA is shown in Figure 1. Associated risk factors (e.g. high blood pressure, tobacco use, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol level and obesity etc) need special emphasis. Lifestyle modification and lack of physical exercise cannot be ignored. In high risk group where TIA lasts longer than 10 minutes with significant neuro deficit in elderly subjects having diabetes or hypertension will need special attention and treatment. Diagnostic tests should include cardiovascular evaluation and ultrasound scanning of carotid arteries. Special neuroimaging tests like CT/MRI and CTA/MRA to visualize cerebral vasculature and detect asymptomatic lesions are helpful in planning long term management and prevention of stroke.

Abstract
AIM OF WORK:

The aim of our work was to detect any structural or functional visual defects during and in between the attacks in patients with migraine.
PATIENT AND METHODS:

Sixty patients with migraine as well as sixty age and sex matched controls were included. All cases were subjected to full ophthalmological examination. Cases with any previously known optic nerve abnormalities or with history of increased intraocular pressure were excluded from this study. A full threshold 24-2 automated perimetry as well as optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed for retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness. Correlations between results of study group with migraine and controls were analyzed and recorded.
RESULTS:

There was a statistically significant difference between the patients with migraine and the controls in visual field analysis which was (P < 0.05) for generalized visual field deficits and (P < 0.001) for localized visual field deficits during the attack with no statistically significant difference in visual field in between the attacks (P > 0.05). OCT RNFL thickness had no statistically significant difference between migraine and control groups (P > 0.05).
CONCLUSION:

Migraine can cause functional ocular disorder without any structural abnormalities.

[Cortical spreading depression and pain: a missing link in the pathophysiology of migraine?].
[Article in Japanese]
Kowa H1, Takigawa H, Nakashima K.
Author information
Abstract

It is generally believed that cortical spreading depression (CSD) demonstrated by Leao underlie migraine aura and migraine headache depends on the activation of the trigeminovascular pain pathway proposed by Moskowitz. The onset of migraine attack and the association between CSD and the trigeminovascular pain pathway have remained largely unknown. Recent animal studies indicate that CSD can activate trigeminal nociception and thus trigger headache mechanism. Meanwhile, the nature and mechanism of migraine without aura is still an open question. It is considered that the pain in migraineur is affected by hereditary factors, internal factors such as female sex hormone, and external factors as medication, meal, weather, stress, etc. We review here the current understanding of the migraine pathophysiology, focusing on recent advance regarding cortical spreading depression and pain.

Transient ischaemic attack clinic: an evaluation of diagnoses and clinical decision making.
Lee W1, Frayne J2.
Author information
Abstract

The diagnosis of transient ischaemic attack (TIA) is based largely on the patient's symptom recall and clinical judgement. This decision-making process is highly subjective and the inter-observer reliability of TIA diagnosis is at best moderate, even among neurologists. The aim of this study is to examine the presenting features and final diagnoses of referrals to a TIA clinic and to evaluate characteristics that favoured the diagnosis of TIA over other TIA "mimics". Consecutive new referrals to a tertiary metropolitan hospital TIA clinic over a 9month period were examined. Characteristics between TIA and non-TIA diagnoses were compared and analysed. Eighty-two patients were recruited. Eighteen (22%) were given a final diagnosis of TIA or stroke. Major alternative diagnoses included migraine (n=17, 21%), presyncope/syncope (n=13, 16%) and anxiety (n=7, 9%). Four (5%) patients had unclassifiable symptoms with no clear final diagnosis. Mean age was 67±a standard deviation of 17years and patients diagnosed with TIA/stroke were on average older than those with non-TIA diagnoses (77±10 versus 64±17years, p=0.003). A diagnosis of TIA/stroke was favoured in the presence of moderate to severe weakness (p=0.032), dysphasia (p=0.037) or dysarthria (p=0.005). Unclassifiable symptoms (for example, palpitations, confusion, headache) were reported in 27 patients (33%) and their presence favoured non-TIA diagnoses (p=0.0003). TIA constituted a minority of the referrals to our clinic. Accurate clinical diagnosis of TIA facilitates early stroke prevention and avoids unnecessary investigations and prescriptions. Attempts to improve diagnostic accuracy of TIA should target improving the education and awareness of frontline medical practitioners.

The influence of weather on migraine - are migraine attacks predictable?
Hoffmann J1, Schirra T1, Lo H1, Neeb L1, Reuter U1, Martus P2.
Author information
Abstract
OBJECTIVE:

The study aimed at elucidating a potential correlation between specific meteorological variables and the prevalence and intensity of migraine attacks as well as exploring a potential individual predictability of a migraine attack based on meteorological variables and their changes.
METHODS:

Attack prevalence and intensity of 100 migraineurs were correlated with atmospheric pressure, relative air humidity, and ambient temperature in 4-h intervals over 12 consecutive months. For each correlation, meteorological parameters at the time of the migraine attack as well as their variation within the preceding 24 h were analyzed. For migraineurs showing a positive correlation, logistic regression analysis was used to assess the predictability of a migraine attack based on meteorological information.
RESULTS:

In a subgroup of migraineurs, a significant weather sensitivity could be observed. In contrast, pooled analysis of all patients did not reveal a significant association. An individual prediction of a migraine attack based on meteorological data was not possible, mainly as a result of the small prevalence of attacks.
INTERPRETATION:

The results suggest that only a subgroup of migraineurs is sensitive to specific weather conditions. Our findings may provide an explanation as to why previous studies, which commonly rely on a pooled analysis, show inconclusive results. The lack of individual attack predictability indicates that the use of preventive measures based on meteorological conditions is not feasible.

Migraine is underdiagnosed and undertreated.
Miller S1, Matharu MS.
Author information
Abstract

Migraine is a common neurovascular disorder characterised by attacks of head pain that are typically unilateral and often described as severe and throbbing in association with nausea and sensitivity to sensory input, i.e. light, sound and head movement. The headaches typically last 4-72 hours, up to 31% of migraineurs have aura on some occasions. Migraine is commonly episodic. With an increasing intake of painkillers, patients often complain of an escalation of migraine attacks or a transformation to a chronic daily background pain with exacerbations. Acute painkiller use, both prescription and OTC, should be enquired about in all cases and medication overuse headache suspected and managed if patients are taking any acute painkiller excessively. Migraineurs should be encouraged to have regular habits. Regular sleep, exercise, meals, work habits and relaxation will be rewarded by a reduction in headache frequency. NICE guidelines recommend adopting the stepped-down approach to management. They suggest a combination of a triptan, NSAID or paracetamol, and an anti-emetic taken as early as possible during the headache. The decision to commence a preventative agent should depend on a combination of attack frequency, duration and severity, as well as response to abortive therapy and patient preference.

Critical reappraisal of intravenous metoclopramide in migraine attack: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
Eken C1.
Author information
Abstract

Migraine is one of the most common causes of headache presentations to emergency departments (EDs). Patients with migraine attack need rapid pain relief rather than diagnostic modalities. Metoclopramide, a dopamine antagonist with a primary use of antiemetic, has been used commonly in ceasing migraine attack. An earlier meta-analysis favors metoclopramide over placebo but includes studies with significant methodological errors and heterogeneity. The present article aimed to review the literature to reveal studies comparing metoclopramide to either placebo or active comparators. A literature search including PubMed, Cochrane Database, and Google Scholar was performed by using the evidence-based process for determining the study quality. Although the studies comparing parenteral metoclopramide to placebo in ceasing migraine headache favor metoclopramide to placebo and lower rates of rescue drug need, however, they lack high methodological quality even to perform a meta-analysis. Meanwhile, the effect of metoclopramide in ceasing migraine headache is also comparable to active comparators. It seems reasonable to use metoclopramide in migraine attacks in EDs according to the current literature. However, further studies with high methodological quality are needed to reveal whether and how much metoclopramide is superior to placebo.

Transcranial direct current stimulation in the prophylactic treatment of migraine based on interictal visual cortex excitability abnormalities: A pilot randomized controlled trial.
Rocha S1, Melo L2, Boudoux C3, Foerster Á4, Araújo D5, Monte-Silva K6.
Author information
Abstract
PURPOSE:

The aims of this paper are (i) to compare the excitability of visual cortex in migraine patients with healthy volunteers; and (ii) if an abnormal excitability has been found, to modulate cortical excitability in migraine patients with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and observe their clinical and neurophysiological effects.
METHODS:

The study was divided into two steps. A cross-sectional study (step 1) was conducted to compare the cortical excitability of 23 migraineurs (11 with and 12 without aura) on 11 healthy individuals. On step 2, a randomized, double blinded, controlled pilot trial was carried on with 19 migraineurs, randomly divided into: experimental and control group. During 12 sessions, experimental and group received active tDCS to visual cortex and control group received sham tDCS. The headache diary was applied for a total of 90days (before, during and after tDCS sessions). Phosphene threshold (PT) induced by transcranial magnetic stimulation was recorded to measure the excitability of the visual cortex before and after each session.
RESULTS:

Step 1 showed higher level of cortical excitability between migraineurs when compared to healthy volunteers; therefore, cathodal tDCS was applied over visual cortex in step 2. After tDCS application, a significant decrease was observed in a number of migraine attacks, painkiller intake and duration of each attack just in experimental group. The analysis of PT indicated no difference in cortical excitability after tDCS.
CONCLUSIONS:

Findings of the study suggested that inhibitory tDCS on visual cortex might be an alternative and non-pharmacological treatment for migraine prophylaxis. However the clinical improvements of patients after tDCS treatment are not correlated with changes in cortical excitability.

Chocolate and migraine: the history of an ambiguous association.
Lippi G1, Mattiuzzi C, Cervellin G.
Author information
Abstract

Migraine is a highly prevalent condition and an important cause of disability. Although the pathogenesis of this condition is complex and multifaceted, several environmental factors have been associated with development and aggravation of headache attacks. Among the various foods that have been implicated in migraine, chocolate has been regarded as detrimental on the basis of old and mostly anecdotal evidence. Therefore, this article is aimed to provide an overview on the current scientific evidence about the relationship between chocolate and migraine. Taken together, the information gathered from epidemiological and provocative studies attests that the potential causal association between chocolate and migraine remains largely enigmatic. The analysis of epidemiological surveys reveals a highly heterogeneous picture, with frequency of migraine episodes attributable to chocolate ranging from 0 to 22.5%. Even in those studies reporting a more convincing association, the risk of migraine after chocolate ingestion was found to be 2- to 3-fold lower than that reported for exposure to other conventional triggers such as stress, fasting, lack of sleep and alcohol beverages. The results of the double-blind studies are instead unequivocal, and clearly demonstrate that the risk of developing a headache attack after ingestion of chocolate is as likely as administering placebo in patients with migraine. It can hence be concluded that the widespread belief that chocolate and cocoacontaining foods should be absolutely avoided by migraine patients lacks of a reliable scientific basis.

[Contribution of arterial spin labeling to the diagnosis of sudden and transient neurological deficit].
[Article in French]
Yger M1, Villain N2, Belkacem S3, Bertrand A3, Rosso C2, Crozier S2, Samson Y2, Dormont D3.
Author information
Abstract

MRI is the gold standard exploration for sudden transient neurological events. If diffusion MRI is negative, there may be a diagnostic doubt between transient ischemic attack and other causes of transient neurological deficit. We illustrate how sequence arterial spin labeling (ASL), which evaluates cerebral perfusion, contributes to the exploration of transient neurological events. An ASL sequence was performed in seven patients with a normal diffusion MRI explored for a transient deficit. Cortical hyperperfusion not systematized to an arterial territory was found in three and hypoperfusion systematized to an arterial territory in four. ASL helped guide early management of these patients.

Interictal cerebral and systemic endothelial dysfunction in patients with migraine: a case-control study.
Rajan R1, Khurana D1, Lal V1.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Although systemic endothelial function is unimpaired in migraine, it is unknown whether cerebral endothelial function impairment exists in migraineurs.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:

We conducted a prospective study to assess endothelial function in migraineurs (n=45) and healthy volunteers (n=44). Cerebral endothelial function was assessed by Breath Holding Index (BHI) on transcranial Doppler in bilateral middle cerebral artery (MCA at 30-60 mm), posterior cerebral artery (PCA at 60-80 mm) and basilar artery (BA at 80-120 mm) using bilateral monitoring probes fixed on headband. Brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD) was used as measure of systemic endothelial function.
RESULTS:

There was no difference in baseline mean velocities of MCA, PCA, BA among migraineurs and controls. Mean BHI was significantly lower in PCA (p<0.001) and BA (p<0.001) in patients with migraine with no difference in MCA (p=0.909, 0.450). Cerebral endothelial dysfunction (BHI<1.15) was present in 62.2% of migraineurs in the right PCA (p<0.001), 57.8% in left PCA (p<0.001) and 77.8% in BA (BHI <0.83, p<0.001). There was no difference in BHI among migraineurs without and with aura (n=15). Cerebral and systemic endothelial function had no correlation in migraineurs. Increasing BMI was identified as a predictor of impaired BHI in the BA in migraineurs (p=0.020). Age, sex, presence of aura, lateralisation of headache, headache frequency, time to last attack and impaired FMD were not associated with impaired PCA and BA BHI in migraineurs.
CONCLUSIONS:

Migraineurs may have isolated cerebral endothelial dysfunction restricted to the posterior circulation in the absence of systemic endothelial dysfunction.

Association of pre- and post-treatment expectations with improvements after acupuncture in patients with migraine.
Zheng H1, Huang W2, Li J1, Zheng Q1, Li Y1, Chang X3, Sun G4, Liang F1.
Author information
Abstract
OBJECTIVE:

To study whether a higher expectation of acupuncture measured at baseline and after acupuncture is associated with better outcome improvements in patients with migraine.
METHODS:

We performed a secondary analysis of a previous published trial in which 476 patients with migraine were randomly allocated to three real acupuncture groups and one sham acupuncture control group. All the participants received 20 sessions of acupuncture over a 4-week period. The primary outcome was the number of days with a migraine attack (NDMA) assessed at 5-8 weeks after randomisation. The secondary outcomes were visual analogue scale, headache intensity and quality of life assessed at 4, 8 and 16 weeks after randomisation. Expectations of the acupuncture effect were assessed at baseline and at the end of treatment and categorised into five levels, with 0% the lowest and 100% the highest. Outcome improvement was first compared among the participants with different expectation levels using an analysis of variance model. The association between expectations of treatment and outcome improvement was then calculated using a logistic regression model.
RESULTS:

Patients with 100% baseline expectations did not report significantly fewer NDMA than those with 0% baseline expectations after adjusting for the covariates (at 5-8 weeks, 1.7 vs 3.9 days, p=0.987). High baseline expectations had no significant impact on improvement of the primary outcome (100% vs 0%: OR 8.50, 95% CI 0.89 to 191.65, p=0.682). However, patients with 100% post-treatment expectations reported fewer NDMA than those with 0% expectations (primary outcome: 1.3 vs 5.0 days, p<0.001) and were more likely to have a favourable response (100% vs 0%: OR 68.87, 95% CI 6.26 to 1449.73, p=0.002). Similar results were found when analysing the impact of expectation on the secondary outcomes.
CONCLUSIONS:

A high level of expectation after acupuncture treatment rather than at baseline was associated with better long-term outcome improvements in patients with migraine.

Assessment of cognitive dysfunction during migraine attacks: a systematic review.
Gil-Gouveia R1, Oliveira AG, Martins IP.
Author information
Abstract

Patients consistently report cognitive impairment during migraine attacks, yet the documentation of such dysfunction by neuropsychological evaluation has lacked similar consistency. This incongruence may be due to discrepant study designs, assessment tools and small samples sizes. To search for evidence of decline in cognitive functions during a migraine attack, compared to headache-free performance. The secondary objective was to determine if the eventual decline had a consistent neuropsychological pattern. Systematic review of the medical literature using PubMed and Cochrane library databases without limitations or restrictions from inception to March 2014, using the search terms "migraine", "cognition", "neuropsychological". We included studies in episodic migraine that had a neuropsychological evaluation performed during an attack. From 1,023 titles screened, a total of 10 articles met criteria for inclusion and were fully reviewed. Only five of these studies, comprising a total of 163 individuals, had enough data to allow an appraisal of the study question. All five studies were positive in documenting some type of reversible cognitive impairment during the migraine attack. The pattern of cognitive impairment most often documented was of executive dysfunction, but the presence of bias induced by the choice of tests and of small samples prevents this finding from being conclusive. This review supports the existence of reversible cognitive dysfunction during the migraine attack, corroborating patients' subjective descriptions. Further work is needed to establish the pattern of cognitive dysfunction, their underling pathophysiological mechanisms and the impact of these symptoms in migraine-associated disability.

Pharmacological trials in migraine: it's time to reappraise where the headache is and what the pain is like.
Barbanti P1, Egeo G.
Author information
Abstract

Most pharmacological trials deal with migraine as if it were a clinically homogeneous disease, and when detailing its characteristics, they usually report only the presence, or absence, of aura and attack frequency but provide no information on pain location, a non-trivial clinical detail. The past decade has witnessed growing emerging evidence suggesting that individuals with unilateral pain, especially those with associated unilateral cranial autonomic symptoms, are more responsive than others to trigeminal-targeted symptomatic and preventive therapy with drugs such as triptans or botulinum toxin. A simple way for migraine research treatment to take a step forward might be to step back, reappraise, and critically evaluate easily obtainable patient-reported clinical findings along with current knowledge on pain features.

Late-life migraine accompaniments: A narrative review.
Vongvaivanich K1, Lertakyamanee P2, Silberstein SD3, Dodick DW4.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Migraine is one of the most common chronic neurological disorders. In 1980, C. Miller Fisher described late-life migraine accompaniments as transient neurological episodes in older individuals that mimic transient ischemic attacks. There has not been an update on the underlying nature and etiology of late-life migraine accompanimentsd since the original description.
PURPOSE:

The purpose of this article is to provide a comprehensive and extensive review of the late-life migraine accompaniments including the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, differential diagnosis, and treatment.
METHODS:

Literature searches were performed in MEDLINE®, PubMed, Cochrane Library, and EMBASE databases for publications from 1941 to July 2014. The search terms "Migraine accompaniments," "Late life migraine," "Migraine with aura," "Typical aura without headache," "Migraine equivalents," "Acephalic migraine," "Elderly migraine," and "Transient neurological episodes" were used.
CONCLUSION:

Late-life onset of migraine with aura is not rare in clinical practice and can occur without headache, especially in elderly individuals. Visual symptoms are the most common presentation, followed respectively by sensory, aphasic, and motor symptoms. Gradual evolution, the march of transient neurological deficits over several minutes and serial progression from one symptom to another in succession are typical clinical features for late-life migraine accompaniments. Transient neurological disturbances in migraine aura can mimic other serious conditions and can be easily misdiagnosed. Careful clinical correlation and appropriate investigations are essential to exclude secondary causes. Treatments are limited and still inconsistent.

Occipital nerve block for the short-term preventive treatment of migraine: A randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study.
Dilli E1, Halker R2, Vargas B2, Hentz J2, Radam T2, Rogers R2, Dodick D2.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Occipital nerve (ON) injections with corticosteroids and/or local anesthetics have been employed for the acute and preventive treatment of migraine for decades. However, to date there is no randomized, placebo-controlled evidence to support the use of occipital nerve block (ONB) for the prevention of migraine.
OBJECTIVE:

The objective of this article is to determine the efficacy of ONB with local anesthetic and corticosteroid for the preventive treatment of migraine.
PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS:

Patients between 18 and 75 years old with ICHD-II-defined episodic (> 1 attack per week) or chronic migraine (modified ICHD-II as patients with > 10 days with consumption of acute medications were permitted into the study) were randomized to receive either 2.5 ml 0.5% bupivacaine plus 0.5 ml (20 mg) methylprednisolone over the ipsilateral (unilateral headache) or bilateral (bilateral headache) ON or 2.75 ml normal saline plus 0.25 ml 1% lidocaine without epinephrine (placebo). Patients completed a one-month headache diary prior to and after the double-blind injection. The primary outcome measure was defined as a 50% or greater reduction in the frequency of days with moderate or severe migraine headache in the four-week post-injection compared to the four-week pre-injection baseline period.
RESULTS:

Thirty-four patients received active and 35 patients received placebo treatment. Because of missing data, the full analysis of 33 patients in the active and 30 patients in the placebo group was analyzed for efficacy. In the active and placebo groups respectively, the mean frequency of at least moderate (mean 9.8 versus 9.5) and severe (3.6 versus 4.3) migraine days and acute medication days (7.9 versus 10.0) were not substantially different at baseline. The percentage of patients with at least a 50% reduction in the frequency of moderate or severe headache days was 30% for both groups (10/30 vs nine of 30, Δ 0.00, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.23).
CONCLUSIONS:

Greater ONB does not reduce the frequency of moderate to severe migraine days in patients with episodic or chronic migraine compared to placebo.The study was registered with ClinicalTrial.gov (NCT00915473).

    Choroid thickness and ocular pulse amplitude in migraine during attack. [Eye (Lond). 2015]

Abstract
AIM:

To compare the choroidal thickness and ocular pulse amplitude (OPA) measurements obtained during the attack period in migraine patients and age and gender matched control group participants using high definition optical coherence tomography (OCT).
METHODS:

Thirty eyes at the side of the headache of 30 subjects with a diagnosis of migraine with or without aura and unilateral migraine and 29 age and gender matched healthy participants were enrolled in this observational, cross-sectional study. OCT scans were performed to all participants. Choroidal thicknesses were measured at the fovea, 1500 μm nasal and 1500 μm temporal to the fovea. Intraocular pressure (IOP) and OPA were also measured.
RESULTS:

The choroidal thickness measurements obtained during the attack period in migraine patients were (mean±SD) 279.82±35.87, 250.05±29.49, and 239.58±27.92 and in control group were 308.20±44.97, 276.95±41.39, and 281.60±41.38 at foveal, nasal, and temporal measurement points, respectively. Choroidal thickness significantly decreased according to the control group (P<0.05) at all measured points in migraine patients during attack. IOP (mean±SD) values were 16.71±3.26 and17.40±3.19 and OPA (mean±SD) values were 2.26±0.81 and 2.64±1.03 in migraine and control groups, respectively, and did not seem to be changed (P>0.05).
CONCLUSIONS:

Choroidal thickness was found to be significantly decreased in unilateral migraine patients during the attack period when compared with the control group, whereas OPA did not change. The possible implications of these findings on the association between migraine and glaucoma are discussed.

Features of migraine aura in teenagers.
Petrusic I1, Pavlovski V, Vucinic D, Jancic J.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Complex migraine aura in teenagers can be complicated to diagnose. The aim of this study was to present detailed features of migraine aura in teenage migraineurs.
METHODS:

This cross-sectional study was conducted in the period from 2008 till 2013. A total number of 40 teenage migraineurs (20 females and 20 males) met criteria for this study. The patients were interviewed using a specially designed questionnaire for collecting data about migraine aura features. Main outcome measures were frequency of visual, somatosensory and higher cortical dysfunction (HCD) symptoms in teenage migraineurs population during the aura, and also within each individual.
RESULTS:

Visual aura was reported in every attack, followed by somatosensory (60%) and dysphasic (36.4%) aura. Scintillating scotoma and blurry vision were mostly reported and predominant visual symptoms. The most common somatosensory symptom was numbness in hand. HCD were reported by 22 (55%) patients. Slowed speech was mostly reported symptom of HCD, followed by dyslexia, déjà vu phenomenon, color dysgnosia, and dyspraxia. In patients with HCD, aura frequency per year (6.18 ± 3.17 vs. 3.33 ± 2.03, p = 0.003) and prevalence of somatosensory symptoms (77.3% vs. 38.9%, p = 0.014) were significantly higher than in patients without HCD.
CONCLUSIONS:

Aura symptoms vary to a great extent in complexity in teenage migraineurs. Consequently, results obtained in this study provide useful information for clinicians when faced with unusual migraine aura.

Grey zones in the diagnosis of adult migraine without aura based on the International Classification of Headache Disorders-III beta: exploring the covariates of possible migraine without aura.
Ozge A, Aydinlar E, Tasdelen B.
Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Exploring clinical characteristics and migraine covariates may be useful in the diagnosis of migraine without aura.
OBJECTIVE:

To evaluate the diagnostic value of the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD)-III beta-based diagnosis of migraine without aura; to explore the covariates of possible migraine without aura using an analysis of grey zones in this area; and, finally, to make suggestions for the final version of the ICHD-III.
METHODS:

A total of 1365 patients (mean [± SD] age 38.5±10.4 years, 82.8% female) diagnosed with migraine without aura according to the criteria of the ICHD-III beta were included in the present tertiary care-based retrospective study. Patients meeting all of the criteria of the ICHD-III beta were classified as having full migraine without aura, while those who did not meet one, two or ≥3 of the diagnostic criteria were classified as zones I, II and III, respectively. The diagnostic value of the clinical characteristics and covariates of migraine were determined.
RESULTS:

Full migraine without aura was evident in 25.7% of the migraineurs. A higher likelihood of zone I classification was shown for an attack lasting 4 h to 72 h (OR 1.560; P=0.002), with pulsating quality (OR 4.096; P<0.001), concomitant nausea⁄vomiting (OR 2.300; P<0.001) and photophobia⁄phonophobia (OR 4.865; P<0.001). The first-rank determinants for full migraine without aura were sleep irregularities (OR 1.596; P=0.005) and periodic vomiting (OR 1.464; P=0.026). However, even if not mentioned in ICHD-III beta, the authors determined that motion sickness, abdominal pain or infantile colic attacks in childhood, associated dizziness and osmophobia have important diagnostic value.
CONCLUSIONS:

In cases that do not fulfill all of the diagnostic criteria although they are largely consistent with the characteristics of migraine in clinical terms, the authors believe that a history of infantile colic; periodic vomiting (but not periodic vomiting syndrome); recurrent abdominal pain; the presence of motion sickness or vertigo, dizziness or osmophobia accompanying the pain; and comorbid atopic disorder are characteristics that should to be discussed and considered as additional diagnostic criteria (covariates) in the preparation of the final version of ICHD-III.

Author information
Abstract
INTRODUCTION:

Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is associated with cryptogenic strokes, recurrent transient neurologic deficits, sleep apnea, decompression illness and migraines with aura.
AIM:

We verify cryptogenic embolism recurrence after transcatheter PFO closure in patients younger than 55 years old, and determine the prevalence of migraine with aura before and after PFO closure.
MATERIAL AND METHODS:

We sent a questionnaire concerning the recurrence of stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) and the presence of migraine symptoms before and after PFO closure to 224 consecutive patients (mean age 40.9 ±9 years; 103 men; 108 patients < 40 years old, 116 patients 40-55 years old) after successful PFO transcatheter closure as secondary prevention of cryptogenic embolism.
RESULTS:

The mean follow-up period was 37.8 ±32.5 (median 27) months. Stroke or TIA recurred in 6 patients (2.6%), all of whom were over 40 years old at the time of closure. The median time of recurrence was 24 months. Two patients (0.89%) died, but the deaths were not related to the device nor to thromboembolism. Migraine occurred in the study group before closure in 68 (30.4%) patients. After the procedure 55 (80.9%) reported improvement or disappearance of migraine symptoms.
CONCLUSIONS:

Recurrent strokes after PFO closure are rare, and they occur more often in patients over 40 years old at the time of closure. The PFO closure results in migraine subsiding or symptoms noticeably ameliorating.

Theory-based analysis of clinical efficacy of triptans using receptor occupancy.
Tokuoka K, Takayanagi R, Suzuki Y, Watanabe M, Kitagawa Y, Yamada Y1.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Triptans, serotonin 5-HT1B/1D receptor agonists, exert their action by targeting serotonin 5-HT1B/1D receptors, are used for treatment of migraine attack. Presently, 5 different triptans, namely sumatriptan, zolmitriptan, eletriptan, rizatriptan, and naratriptan, are marketed in Japan. In the present study, we retrospectively analyzed the relationships of clinical efficacy (headache relief) in Japanese and 5-HT1B/1D receptor occupancy (Φ1B and Φ1D). Receptor occupancies were calculated from both the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data of triptans.
METHODS:

To evaluate the total amount of exposure to drug, we calculated the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUCcp) and the areas under the time curves for Ф1B and Ф1D (AUCФ1B and AUCФ1D). Moreover, parameters expressing drug transfer and binding rates (Acp, AФ1B, AФ1D) were calculated.
RESULTS:

Our calculations showed that Фmax1B and Фmax1D were relatively high at 32.0-89.4% and 68.4-96.2%, respectively, suggesting that it is likely that a high occupancy is necessary to attain the clinical effect. In addition, the relationships between therapeutic effect and AUCcp, AUCΦ1B, AUCΦ1D, and Acp · AUCcp differed with each drug and administered form, whereas a significant relationship was found between the therapeutic effect and AΦ1B · AUCΦ1B or AΦ1D · AUCΦ1D that was not affected by the drug and the form of administration.
CONCLUSIONS:

These results suggest that receptor occupancy can be used as a parameter for a common index to evaluate the therapeutic effect. We considered that the present findings provide useful information to support the proper use of triptans.

Dietary patterns according to headache and migraine status: a cross-sectional study.
Rist PM1, Buring JE2, Kurth T3.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Several potential dietary trigger factors for migraine have been proposed. However, few studies have examined the intake pattern of these dietary items compared to adequate control populations and whether intake levels may vary by migraine aura status or attack frequency.
METHODS:

We conducted a cross-sectional study among participants in the Women's Health Study. We used logistic regression to evaluate the association between migraine and headache status and low intake of foods commonly reported to affect migraine.
RESULTS:

A total of 25,755 women reported no history of migraine or headache, 5573 reported non-migraine headache and 7042 reported any migraine. Those with non-migraine headache or any migraine were more likely to have low intake of total alcohol (OR = 1.22, 95% CI:1.14-1.29 and OR = 1.17, 95% CI:1.11-1.24, respectively). Migraineurs with aura were more likely to have low intake of chocolate, ice cream, hot dogs, and processed meats. Those who experience migraine at least once per week were more likely to have low intake of skim/low-fat milk and white and red wine.
CONCLUSION:

Intake of most suggested migraine dietary triggers differs by migraine aura status and attack frequency, a pattern not found for non-migraine headache.

Abstract
BACKGROUND AND AIMS:

Migraine headache is one of the most common primary headache disorders and is three times more prevalent in women than in men, especially during the reproductive ages. The neurobiological basis of the female dominance has been partly established. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of gender on the headache manifestations in migraine patients.
METHODS:

The study group consisted of 2082 adult patients from five different hospitals' tertiary care-based headache clinics. The relationship between headache characteristics and gender was evaluated in migraine with aura (MwA) and migraine without aura (MwoA). The duration, severity, frequency of headache and associated symptoms were evaluated in both genders and age-dependent variations and analyzed in two subgroups.
RESULTS:

Women with migraine were prone to significantly longer duration and intensity of headache attacks. Nausea, phonophobia and photophobia were more prevalent in women. Median headache duration was also longer in women than in men in MwA (p = 0.013) and MwoA (p < 0.001). Median headache intensity was higher in women than in men in MwA (p = 0.010) and MwoA (p = 0.009). The frequency of nausea was significantly higher in women than in men in MwA (p = 0.049). Throbbing headache quality and associated features (nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia) were significantly more frequent in women than in men in MwoA. The gender impact varied across age groups and significant changes were seen in female migraineurs after age 30. No age-dependent variation was observed in male migraineurs.
CONCLUSION:

Gender has an influence on the characteristics of the headache as well as on the associated symptoms in migraine patients, and this impact varies across the age groups, particularly in women.

Differentiation of true transient ischemic attack versus transient ischemic attack mimics.
Noureddine A1, Ghandehari K2, Taghi Shakeri M3.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Previous literatures have shown a transient ischemic attack (TIA) mimic rate of 9-31%. We aimed to ascertain the proportion of stroke mimics amongst suspected TIA patients.
METHODS:

A prospective observational study was performed in Ghaem Hospital, Mashhad, Iran during 2012-2013. Consecutive TIA patients were identified in a stroke center. The initial diagnosis of TIA was made by the resident of neurology and final diagnosis of true TIA versus TIA mimics was made after 3 months follow-up by stroke subspecialist.
RESULTS:

A total of 310 patients were assessed during a 3-month period of which 182 (58.7%) subjects were male and 128 (41.3%) were female. Ten percent of the patients was categorized as a TIA mimic. The presence of hypertension, aphasia, duration of symptoms, and increased age was the strongest predictor of a true TIA. Migraine was the most common etiology of stroke mimic in our study.
CONCLUSION:

It seems that many signs and symptoms have low diagnostic usefulness for discrimination of true TIA from non-cerebrovascular events and predictive usefulness of any sign or symptom should be interpreted by a stroke neurologist.

Author information
Abstract

To investigate the associations of serum levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM1) and the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-6 (IL-6) with migraine and migraine subtypes, and to study their correlation with each other in this condition. We used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to measure serum levels of ICAM1 and IL-6 in 103 migraine patients with and without aura, in both attack and pain-free periods, and in 100 healthy control subjects. Serum levels of ICAM1 and IL-6 were significantly higher in migraine patients during attacks than in controls (p < 0.05). Serum ICAM1 levels were significantly higher in migraine with aura (MA) than in migraine without aura (MO), (p < 0.05). Correlation analysis indicated a significant positive correlation between serum levels of ICAM1 and IL-6 (p < 0.05) in migraine patients during attacks. Our results indicate that ICAM1 and IL-6 are involved in the pathogenesis of migraine attacks, possibly via an interactive mechanism.

The Flatstent versus the conventional umbrella devices in the percutaneous closure of patent foramen ovale.
Aral M1, Mullen M.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Patent foramen ovale (PFO) has been associated with paradoxical embolism leading to stroke/transient ischemic attack, migraine, and neurological decompression sickness. In search for the optimal device that would achieve effective clinical closure with minimal complications, a better device selection based on PFO anatomy and improvements in device design is needed. The Flatstent is a new device designed to treat the highly prevalent long-tunnel PFOs from within, minimizing the amount of material left behind in an attempt to reduce device-related complications. The objective is to compare the safety and efficacy of the novel Flatstent versus the conventional umbrella devices in the transcatheter closure of PFO in a nonrandomized, retrospective, single-center study.
METHODS:

Between March 2010 and March 2013, 88 patients underwent PFO closure at The Heart Hospital, London with either the novel Flatstent or one of the four conventionally used umbrella devices (GORE Helex Septal Occluder, Occlutech Figulla Flex, Biostar Septal Occluder, and Amplatzer PFO Occluder) depending on their PFO anatomy. Patients were then evaluated with contrast transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) and/or transoesophageal echocardiography (TOE) at 6 weeks and 1 year after the procedure. The residual shunt and complication rates between the Flatstent and umbrella devices were compared.
RESULTS:

The Flatstent was used in 27 patients (30.7%), whereas 61 patients (69.3%) received one of the four umbrella devices. Primary efficacy point of clinical closure defined as grade 0 or grade 1; residual shunt was achieved in 81.3% in the Flatstent cohort and 80.3% in the umbrella device group at 6 weeks follow-up. At 1 year, the clinical closure rates reached 92.6 and 91.8%. There were two device embolizations, one in each cohort during the immediate postoperative period (<24 hrs), with successful retrieval. One patient in the umbrella device group developed transient atrial fibrillation, which was controlled medically. Event recurrence rate was 0% at 1 year.
CONCLUSION:

No difference was found in closure or complication rates between the Flatstent and the umbrella devices. With appropriate preassessment of the PFO anatomy, the Flatstent works as a safe and effective method of treating the PFO from within the tunnel, especially in those with long-tunnel PFOs. Longer follow-up is needed to establish superiority.

Biphasic neurovascular changes in prolonged migraine aura in familial hemiplegic migraine type 2.
Iizuka T1, Tominaga N1, Kaneko J1, Sato M1, Akutsu T1, Hamada J1, Sakai F2, Nishiyama K1.
Author information
Abstract
OBJECTIVE:

To report biphasic changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) in the acute phase of hemiplegic migraine with prolonged aura (HMPA), in which aura symptoms lasted longer than 24 h, in three patients with familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) carrying a p.H916L mutation in ATP1A2 gene.
METHODS:

We assessed neurovascular changes with time in the affected cerebral hemisphere corresponding to aura symptoms during the acute phase of HMPA. Arterial spin labelling MRI, SPECT for CBF measurement and EEG in three attacks, in one attack FDG-PET measurement for cerebral metabolism was performed. We evaluated CBF at different phases of aura symptoms in 11 attacks of HMPA.
RESULTS:

In two attacks, we found biphasic CBF changes beginning with hypoperfusion followed by persistent hyperperfusion. FDG-PET revealed increased cerebral glucose metabolism in the regions corresponding to hyperperfusion on day 4 when aura symptoms still persisted. In four attacks, Z-score-based CBF mapping revealed multifocal hypoperfusion in the early phase. Hypoperfusion in our study was seen within 19 h of the onset of the symptoms in five of seven attacks, while hyperperfusion was seen 18 h or later in eight of nine attacks. EEG showed attenuated alpha activity without paroxysmal discharge.
CONCLUSIONS:

This is the first report showing biphasic CBF changes during the prolonged aura of FHM2. This study suggested that the results of cross-sectional CBF studies should be interpreted carefully. Initial multifocal hypoperfusion is likely due to functional depression of multifocal origin in the affected hemisphere, but the mechanism of persistent hyperperfusion requires further investigation.

Headache Following Occipital Brain Lesion: A Case of Migraine Triggered by Occipital Spikes?
Vollono C1, Mariotti P2, Losurdo A3, Giannantoni NM3, Mazzucchi E3, Valentini P2, De Rose P2, Della Marca G3.
Author information
Abstract

This study describes the case of an 8-year-old boy who developed a genuine migraine after the surgical excision, from the right occipital lobe, of brain abscesses due to selective infestation of the cerebrum by Entamoeba histolytica. After the surgical treatment, the boy presented daily headaches with typical migraine features, including right-side parieto-temporal pain, nausea, vomiting, and photophobia. Electroencephalography (EEG) showed epileptiform discharges in the right occipital lobe, although he never presented seizures. Clinical and neurophysiological observations were performed, including video-EEG and polygraphic recordings. EEG showed "interictal" epileptiform discharges in the right occipital lobe. A prolonged video-EEG recording performed before, during, and after an acute attack ruled out ictal or postictal migraine. In this boy, an occipital lesion caused occipital epileptiform EEG discharges without seizures, probably prevented by the treatment. We speculate that occipital spikes, in turn, could have caused a chronic headache with features of migraine without aura. Occipital epileptiform discharges, even in absence of seizures, may trigger a genuine migraine, probably by means of either the trigeminovascular or brainstem system.

Gellan gum-based mucoadhesive microspheres of almotriptan for nasal administration: Formulation optimization using factorial design, characterization, and in vitro evaluation.
Abbas Z1, Marihal S1.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Almotriptan malate (ALM), indicated for the treatment of migraine in adults is not a drug candidate feasible to be administered through the oral route during the attack due to its associated symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. This obviates an alternative dosage form and nasal drug delivery is a good substitute to oral and parenteral administration.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:

Gellan gum (GG) microspheres of ALM, for intranasal administration were prepared by water-in-oil emulsification cross-linking technique employing a 2(3) factorial design. Drug to polymer ratio, calcium chloride concentration and cross-linking time were selected as independent variables, while particle size and in vitro mucoadhesion of the microspheres were investigated as dependent variables. Regression analysis was performed to identify the best formulation conditions. The microspheres were evaluated for characteristics such as practical percentage yield, particle size, percentage incorporation efficiency, swellability, zeta potential, in vitro mucoadhesion, thermal analysis, X-ray diffraction study, and in vitro drug diffusion studies.
RESULTS:

The shape and surface characteristics of the microspheres were determined by scanning electron microscopy, which revealed spherical nature and nearly smooth surface with drug incorporation efficiency in the range of 71.65 ± 1.09% - 91.65 ± 1.13%. In vitro mucoadhesion was observed the range of 79.45 ± 1.69% - 95.48 ± 1.27%. Differential scanning calorimetry and X-ray diffraction results indicated a molecular level dispersion of drug in the microspheres. In vitro drug diffusion was Higuchi matrix controlled and the release mechanism was found to be non-Fickian. Stability studies indicated that there were no significant deviations in the drug content, in vitro mucoadhesion and in vitro drug diffusion characteristics.
CONCLUSION:

The investigation revealed promising potential of GG microspheres for delivering ALM intranasally for the treatment of migraine.

Population norms for the EQ-5D index scores using Singapore preference weights.
Abdin E1, Subramaniam M, Vaingankar JA, Luo N, Chong SA.
Author information
Abstract
PURPOSE:

To provide norms for the EQ-5D index scores based on Singapore preference weights according to age, sex, ethnicity, and language version and compare the EQ-5D index scores for respondents with and without psychiatric disorders and chronic medical conditions.
METHODS:

The Singapore Mental Health Study was a cross-sectional epidemiological survey of a nationally representative sample of the resident (citizens and permanent residents) population in Singapore. The diagnoses of psychiatric disorders were established using the World Mental Health Composite International Diagnostic Interview version 3.0 (CIDI 3.0). Index scores were derived using the Singapore preference weights.
RESULTS:

In general, the mean EQ-5D index score using Singapore preference weights decreased with increased age. The EQ-5D Malay version reported lower mean EQ-5D index than the English version. In multivariate analysis, the mean EQ-5D index for respondents with MDD, dysthymia, bipolar disorder, GAD, OCD, diabetes, hypertension, arthritis or rheumatism, neurological condition, stroke or major paralysis, heart attack, back problems, stomach ulcer, kidney failure, migraine headaches, and chronic lung disease was significantly lower than those without these conditions.
CONCLUSIONS:

These findings support the use of the Singapore preference weights for EQ-5D valuations when measuring health-related quality of life and comparing the health burden of psychiatric and chronic physical conditions among adults in Singapore.

Should foam made with physiologic gases be the standard in sclerotherapy?
Wong M1.
Author information
Abstract
OBJECTIVES:

The aim of this paper is to look at the pros and cons of using physiologic gas to produce foam for use in sclerotherapy. With the expanding use of foam sclerotherapy, there have been increased reports of transient neurologic adverse events such as visual disturbance. Although rare, increased numbers of serious adverse events such as transient ischemic attacks (TIAs) and stroke have been described. These events are seen more often in patients who have migraine with aura and those with a right-to-left shunt.
METHODS:

A literature search of the databases Ovid and Google Scholar was performed for studies looking specifically at neurologic side effects associated with sclerotherapy and use of physiologic foams. Included studies were randomized controlled trials, meta-analyses, review articles, observational studies and case studies.
RESULTS:

Although physiologic gases have been shown in several studies to reduce the incidence of visual disturbance, increasing evidence from recent studies suggest endothelin, rather than gas bubbles to be the cause of these side effects. The cause of stroke and TIA has not been proven and occlusion of cerebral arterioles from gas emboli should still be considered. Many authors state that only good quality foam be injected and volumes should be kept low in an attempt to prevent these rare, but potentially serious events. Foam made with physiologic gases are more biocompatible compared to air-based foam and have been found to be at least as effective in sclerotherapy as foam made with room air.
CONCLUSION:

The use of physiologic gases should be considered for those at increased risk of neurologic side effects such as migraineurs with aura and those with a known PFO. Additionally, as there are few disadvantages to the use of physiologic foam, the use of CO2 or CO2/O2 foam should be considered in all patients receiving foam sclerotherapy.

Ion selectivity strategies of sodium channel selectivity filters.
Dudev T1, Lim C.
Author information
Abstract

CONSPECTUS: Sodium ion channels selectively transport Na(+) cations across the cell membrane. These integral parts of the cell machinery are implicated in regulating the cardiac, skeletal and smooth muscle contraction, nerve impulses, salt and water homeostasis, as well as pain and taste perception. Their malfunction often results in various channelopathies of the heart, brain, skeletal muscles, and lung; thus, sodium channels are key drug targets for various disorders including cardiac arrhythmias, heart attack, stroke, migraine, epilepsy, pain, cancer, and autoimmune disorders. The ability of sodium channels to discriminate the native Na(+) among other competing ions in the surrounding fluids is crucial for proper cellular functions. The selectivity filter (SF), the narrowest part of the channel's open pore, lined with amino acid residues that specifically interact with the permeating ion, plays a major role in determining Na(+) selectivity. Different sodium channels have different SFs, which vary in the symmetry, number, charge, arrangement, and chemical type of the metal-ligating groups and pore size: epithelial/degenerin/acid-sensing ion channels have generally trimeric SFs lined with three conserved neutral serines and/or backbone carbonyls; eukaryotic sodium channels have EKEE, EEKE, DKEA, and DEKA SFs with an invariant positively charged lysine from the second or third domain; and bacterial voltage-gated sodium (Nav) channels exhibit symmetrical EEEE SFs, reminiscent of eukaryotic voltage-gated calcium channels. How do these different sodium channel SFs achieve high selectivity for Na(+) over its key rivals, K(+) and Ca(2+)? What factors govern the metal competition in these SFs and which of these factors are exploited to achieve Na(+) selectivity in the different sodium channel SFs? The free energies for replacing K(+) or Ca(2+) bound inside different model SFs with Na(+), evaluated by a combination of density functional theory and continuum dielectric calculations, have shed light on these questions. The SFs of epithelial and eukaryotic Nav channels select Na(+) by providing an optimal number and ligating strength of metal ligands as well as a rigid pore whose size fits the cognate Na(+) ideally. On the other hand, the SFs of bacterial Nav channels select Na(+), as the protein matrix attenuates ion-protein interactions relative to ion-solvent interactions by enlarging the pore and allowing water to enter, so the ion interacts indirectly with the conserved glutamates via bridging water molecules. This shows how these various SFs have adapted to the specific physicochemical properties of the native ion, using different strategies to select Na(+) among its contenders.

Episodic and electrical nervous system disorders caused by nonchannel genes.
Lee HY1, Fu YH, Ptáček LJ.
Author information
Abstract

As noted in the separate introduction to this special topic section, episodic and electrical disorders can appear quite different clinically and yet share many overlapping features, including attack precipitants, therapeutic responses, natural history, and the types of genes that cause many of the genetic forms (i.e., ion channel genes). Thus, as we mapped and attempted to clone genes causing other episodic disorders, ion channels were always outstanding candidates when they mapped to the critical region of linkage in such a family. However, some of these disorders do not result from mutations in channels. This realization has opened up large and exciting new areas for the pathogenesis of these disorders. In some cases, the mutations occur in genes of unknown function or without understanding of molecular pathogenesis. Recently, emerging insights into a fascinating group of episodic movement disorders, the paroxysmal dyskinesias, and study of the causative genes and proteins are leading to the emerging concept of episodic electric disorders resulting from synaptic dysfunction. Much work remains to be done, but the field is evolving rapidly. As it does, we have come to realize that the molecular pathogenesis of electrical and episodic disorders is more complex than a scenario in which such disorders are simply due to mutations in the primary determinants of membrane excitability (channels).

Methodological issues in studying trigger factors and premonitory features of migraine.
Lipton RB1, Pavlovic JM, Haut SR, Grosberg BM, Buse DC.
Author information
Abstract
OBJECTIVE:

In this review, we focus on migraine as a chronic disorder with episodic attacks (CDEA). We aim to review methodological approaches to studying trigger factors and premonitory features that often precede a migraine attack.
BACKGROUND:

Migraine attacks are sometimes initiated by trigger factors, exposures which increase the probability of an attack. They are heralded by premonitory features, symptoms which warn of an impending attack.
DESIGN/METHODS:

We review candidate predictors of migraine attack and discuss the methodological issues and approaches to studying attack prediction and suggest that electronic diaries may be the method of choice.
CONCLUSION:

Establishing the relationship between antecedent events and headaches is a formidable challenge. Successfully addressing this challenge should provide insights into disease mechanisms and lead to new strategies for treatment. In the second paper in this series, we review the available literature on trigger factors and premonitory features.

Factors associated with emergency department visits for migraine: an observational study.
Minen MT1, Loder E, Friedman B.
Author information
Abstract
OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND:

This study aims to determine why patients with migraine present to an emergency department (ED). While migraine accounts for over 800,000 ED visits annually, no prospectively gathered data characterize patients' reasons for presenting to an ED.
METHODS:

We prospectively interviewed 309 consecutive patients presenting to an urban ED for headache. Patients were asked 100 closed-ended questions regarding sociodemographics, headache history, and current headache attack. We performed descriptive analyses on patients fulfilling International Classification of Headache Disorders 2 migraine criteria.
RESULTS:

Of 186 patients who met migraine criteria, 77% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 71, 83%) had a primary care provider (PCP), 87% (95% CI: 82, 92%) had medical insurance, and 83% (95% CI: 77, 88%) had drug coverage. Fifty-three percent (95% CI: 46, 60%) reported that they previously visited a doctor for headache. Fifty-five percent (95% CI: 48, 62%) previously received a migraine diagnosis. Twenty-two percent (95% CI: 16, 28%) sought medical care for the current headache prior to ED presentation. Fifty-five percent (95% CI: 48, 63%) took abortive medication for migraine on the day of the ED visit. Median headache duration was 24 hours (IQR: 12-72). Forty-nine percent (95% CI: 42, 57%) screened positive for depression. The most common reason for visiting the ED was a perceived emergency condition or referral by a physician (33.3% [95% CI: 27, 40%]). Other commonly cited reasons related to access to care.
CONCLUSIONS:

Most migraineurs presenting to the ED have a PCP and health insurance. ED visits commonly result from an inability to access care elsewhere and because patients consider pain to be an emergency condition. Missed opportunities for diagnosis and treatment likely contribute to ED visits.

Practical implications of the migraine cardio- and cerebrovascular association: unmet needs of patients.
Diener HC1, Kurth T2, Holle D3.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Numerous studies have described a relationship between migraine and stroke, and there is emerging evidence that migraine is also associated with cardiovascular disease. The combination of migraine and both cerebrovascular and cardiovascular disease has implications for therapy.
METHODS:

We conducted a review of the modifications in medical therapy in patients with comorbid migraine and cardio- and cerebrovascular disorders based on publications from the last 15 years.
RESULTS:

Some drugs are contraindicated to treat migraine attacks (ergots, triptans) or for migraine prevention in patients after transient ischemic attack (TIA)/ischemic stroke. Aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are contraindicated in patients with cerebral bleeding. Some drugs for the treatment of acute migraine attacks are contraindicated in patients with symptomatic coronary heart disease.
CONCLUSIONS:

Given the large number of patients with comorbid migraine and cardiovascular as well as cerebrovascular disease, there is an unmet need to treat these patients.

Cognitive dysfunction during migraine attacks: a study on migraine without aura.
Gil-Gouveia R1, Oliveira AG2, Martins IP3.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Cognitive difficulties contribute to patients' disability during migraine attacks and have been overlooked in migraine research. Neuropsychological studies performed during attacks have produced inconsistent findings due to design differences and limitations.
OBJECTIVE:

Our objective is to document changes in cognitive performance of migraine patients during migraine attacks with a comprehensive battery of cognitive/behavioral tests, while controlling for potential confounders.
METHOD:

A prospective two-period, randomized, cross-over study compared within-subject neuropsychological evaluation in two conditions-during a naturally occurring untreated migraine attack and a headache-free period.
RESULTS:

Thirty-nine patients with episodic migraine (37 females, average 38 years old) were included and 24 completed the study. Participants performed worse during the attack in the majority of cognitive tests, compared to the headache-free status, and significantly so in word reading speed (p = 0.013), verbal learning (p = 0.01), short-term verbal recall with (p = 0.01) and without (p = 0.013) semantic cueing and delayed recall with (p = 0.003) and without (p = 0.05) semantic cues. Differences found were unrelated to age, gender, literacy, condition order, interval between evaluations, anxiety, pain intensity or duration of the attack.
DISCUSSION:

Cognitive performance decreases during migraine attacks, especially in reading and processing speed, verbal memory and learning, supporting patients' subjective complaints. These findings suggest the existence of a reversible brain dysfunction during attacks of migraine without aura, which can relate specifically to migraine or be a consequence of acute pain processing by the brain.

Author information
Abstract
OBJECTIVE/BACKGROUND:

The aim of this longitudinal study was to investigate changes of migraine-related brain white matter hyperintensities 3 years after an initial study. Baseline quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of migraine patients with hemispheric white matter hyperintensities performed in 2009 demonstrated signs of tissue damage within the hyperintensities. The hyperintensities appeared most frequently in the deep white matter of the frontal lobe with a similar average hyperintensity size in all hemispheric lobes. Since in this patient group the repeated migraine attacks were the only known risk factors for the development of white matter hyperintensities, the remeasurements of migraineurs after a 3-year long follow-up may show changes in the status of these structural abnormalities as the effects of the repeated headaches.
METHODS:

The same patient group was reinvestigated in 2012 using the same MRI scanner and acquisition protocol. MR measurements were performed on a 3.0-Tesla clinical MRI scanner. Beyond the routine T1-, T2-weighted, and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery imaging, diffusion and perfusion-weighted imaging, proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and T1 and T2 relaxation time measurements were also performed. Findings of the baseline and follow-up studies were compared with each other.
RESULTS:

The follow-up proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies of white matter hyperintensities showed significantly decreased N-acetyl-aspartate (median values 8.133 vs 7.153 mmol/L, P=.009) and creatine/phosphocreatine (median values 4.970 vs 4.641 mmol/L, P=.015) concentrations compared to the baseline, indicating a more severe axonal loss and glial hypocellularity with decreased intracellular energy production. The diffusion values, the T1 and T2 relaxation times, and the cerebral blood flow and volume measurements presented only mild changes between the studies. The number (median values 21 vs 25, P<.001) and volume (median values 0.896 vs 1.140 mL, P<.001) of hyperintensities were significantly higher in the follow-up study. No changes were found in the hemispheric and lobar distribution of hyperintensities. An increase in the hyperintensity size of preexisting lesions was much more common than a decrease (median values 14 vs 5, P=.004). A higher number of newly developed hyperintensities were detected than disappeared ones (130 vs 22), and most of them were small (<.034 mL). Small white matter hyperintensities in patients with a low migraine attack frequency had a higher chance to disappear than large white matter hyperintensities or white matter hyperintensities in patients with a high attack frequency (coefficient: -0.517, P=.034).
CONCLUSIONS:

This longitudinal MRI study found clinically silent brain white matter hyperintensities to be predominantly progressive in nature. The absence of a control group precludes definitive conclusions about the nature of these changes or if their degree is beyond normal aging.

Abstract
INTRODUCTION:

Observations that migraine increases risk of cardiovascular disease and ischemic brain changes may suggest sustained vascular differences between migraineurs and controls. In a population-based setting, we compared cerebral blood flow between migraineurs in the attack-free period and controls.
METHODS:

Between 2006 and 2008, 2642 participants, aged 45-65, from the Rotterdam Study completed a migraine questionnaire and had complete usable MRI data. Participants were classified into controls (N = 2033), probable migraine (N = 153), or migraine (N = 456). Using 2D phase contrast MRI, we performed a cross-sectional analysis of the effect of migraine on total cerebral blood flow (tCBF), parenchymal cerebral blood flow (pCBF), and blood flow in each intracranial arterial using linear regression. Additionally, we performed stratified analysis of subtypes of migraine.
RESULTS:

Compared with controls, migraineurs had higher pCBF (1.07 ml/min/100 ml, 95% CI 0.08; 2.05). In particular, migraineurs had significantly higher blood flow in the basilar artery (4.70 ml/min, 95% CI 0.77; 8.62).
DISCUSSION:

Migraineurs in the attack-free period have higher pCBF, particularly basilar artery flow, compared to controls, supporting the notion of sustained vascular differences between these groups outside of migraine attacks.

The role of headache chronicity among predictors contributing to quality of life in patients with migraine: a hospital-based study.
Kim SY, Park SP1.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Headache chronicity has been known to elicit deleterious effects on quality of life (QOL). We evaluated the contribution of headache chronicity to QOL in relation to clinical, psychiatric, and psychosocial variables in patients with migraine.
METHODS:

Subjects were recruited from a headache clinic and completed self-report questionnaires including the Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI), and Migraine-Specific Quality of Life (MSQoL). We obtained predictors of MSQoL by multiple regression analyses. A path analysis model was constructed to analyze interrelationships between the variables.
RESULTS:

Among 251 eligible patients, 183 (72.9%) had episodic migraine (EM) and 68 (27.1%) had chronic migraine (CM). Patients with CM had more serious clinical, psychiatric, and poor QOL than did patients with EM. The strongest predictor of the MSQoL score in all patients with migraine was the BDI score (β = -0.373, p < 0.001), followed by the MIDAS score (β = -0.223, p < 0.001), female gender (β = -0.192, p < 0.001), attack duration (β = -0.159, p = 0.001), and headache chronicity (β = -0.130, p = 0.012). Headache chronicity had a direct effect on the MSQoL score and exerted an indirect effect on the MSQoL score through the MIDAS and the BDI scores.
CONCLUSIONS:

Chronic migraine appears to impair QOL directly as well as indirectly by provoking disability and depression.

Behavioral effects and mechanisms of migraine pathogenesis following estradiol exposure in a multibehavioral model of migraine in rat.
Vermeer LM1, Gregory E2, Winter MK3, McCarson KE4, Berman NE5.
Author information
Abstract

Migraine is one of the most common neurological disorders, leading to more than 1% of total disability reported and over 68 million visits to emergency rooms or physician's offices each year in the United States. Three times as many women as men have migraine, and while the mechanism behind this is not well understood, 17β-estradiol (estradiol) has been implicated to play a role. Studies have demonstrated that exposure to estrogen can lead to activation of inflammatory pathways, changes in sodium gated channel activity, as well as enhanced vasodilation and allodynia. Estradiol receptors are found in trigeminal nociceptors, which are involved in signaling during a migraine attack. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of estradiol in migraine pathogenesis utilizing a multibehavioral model of migraine in rat. Animals were surgically implanted with a cannula system to induce migraine and behavior was assessed following exposure to a proestrus level of estradiol for total locomotor activity, light and noise sensitivity, evoked grooming patterns, and enhanced acoustic startle response. Results demonstrated decreased locomotor activity, increased light and noise sensitivity, altered facial grooming indicative of allodynia and enhanced acoustic startle. Further examination of tissue samples revealed increased expression of genes associated with inflammation and vasodilation. Overall, this study demonstrates exacerbation of migraine-like behaviors following exposure to estradiol and helps further explain the underlying mechanisms behind sex differences found in this common neurological disorder.

Author information
Abstract
PURPOSE:

The purpose of this study was to assess choroidal thickness in migraine patients during acute migraine attacks and compare them with healthy controls, using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT).
PATIENTS AND METHODS:

In this prospective case-control study, choroidal thicknesses of 46 migraine patients during acute migraine attacks and 46 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were measured using a high-speed, high-resolution frequency domain-OCT device. All patients underwent a complete ophthalmic examination before the measurements. OCT measurements were taken at the same time of day (0900 hours), in order to minimize the effects of diurnal variation.
RESULTS:

There was a statistically significant difference in mean choroidal thickness between the migraine patients during acute migraine attacks (356.3±21.46 μm) and the controls (302.3±18.34 μm; P=0.000). There were significant differences at all measurement points (P<0.001 for all).
CONCLUSION:

The increased choroidal thickness of the migraine patients during acute migraine attacks might be related to the vascular pathology of the disease. Further studies are needed to evaluate the etiopathologic relationship between choroidal thickness and acute migraine attack.

Abstract
AIM:

Chronic migraine is a growing and disabling subtype of migraine with different risk factors and clinical features, even in older adults. We sought to define and differentiate clinical features of chronic migraine in older adults. We also aimed to compare major clinical features of chronic migraine in older adults with those in younger people of both sexes.
METHODS:

We used electronic dataset (Turkish Headache Database) from 13 tertiary headache centers in Turkey. Electronic dataset included detailed headache-defining features according to ICHD-II criteria based on face-to-face interviews and examination by a headache specialist. Using statistical methods, clinical variables of chronic migraine in older adults were compared with those of younger adults. We included 915 patients with chronic migraine (mean age 43.80 ± 13.95 years); 83.3% were females. In total, 301 patients (32.9%) with chronic migraine aged >50 years were compared with 614 patients aged <50 years.
RESULTS:

There was no significant change in men with increasing age. However, duration of headache history, severity of attacks, previous histories of motion sickness and positive family history of headaches were significantly different in women with increasing age. Further sex-related differences have been shown in parameters such as attack duration, quality and associated nausea.
CONCLUSION:

Chronic migraine is an infrequent type of migraine and shows age-related changes in some phenotypic characteristics, such as severity of attacks, especially in women aged older than 50 years. Furthermore, positive family history of headaches and history of motion sickness increase the likelihood of developing chronic migraine in older women, indicating involvement of some gender-related, but as-yet unknown, genetic factors.

Novel strategies for the treatment of migraine attacks via the CGRP, serotonin, dopamine, PAC1, and NMDA receptors.
Tajti J1, Csáti A, Vécsei L.
Author information
Abstract
INTRODUCTION:

Migraine is a common, paroxysmal, and disabling primary headache with a high personal and socioeconomic impact. It involves ∼ 16% of the general population. During the years, a number of hypotheses have been put forward concerning the exact pathomechanism, but the final solution is still undiscovered.
AREAS COVERED:

Although the origin is enigmatic, parallel therapeutic efforts have been developed. Current attack therapy does not meet the expectations of the patients or the doctors. This article, based on a PubMed search, reviews the novel pharmacological possibilities that influence the peripheral and central sensitization involved in the disease.
EXPERT OPINION:

In order to overcome the therapeutic insufficiency, a calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist without the side-effect of liver transaminase elevation is required. Another therapeutic option is to develop a neurally acting antimigraine agent, such as a serotonin-1F receptor agonist, with low adverse central nervous system events. Development of a potent dopamine receptor antagonist is necessary to diminish the premonitory symptoms of migraine. A further option is to decrease the headache intensity with a pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide type 1 receptor blocker which can cross the blood-brain barrier. Finally, synthetic kynurenine analogues are required to block the pain transmission in the activated trigeminal system.

Low heat pain thresholds in migraineurs between attacks.
Schwedt TJ1, Zuniga L2, Chong CD2.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE:

Between attacks, migraine is associated with hypersensitivities to sensory stimuli. The objective of this study was to investigate hypersensitivity to pain in migraineurs between attacks.
METHODS:

Cutaneous heat pain thresholds were measured in 112 migraineurs, migraine free for ≥ 48 hours, and 75 healthy controls. Pain thresholds at the head and at the arm were compared between migraineurs and controls using two-tailed t-tests. Among migraineurs, correlations between heat pain thresholds and headache frequency, allodynia symptom severity, and time interval until next headache were calculated.
RESULTS:

Migraineurs had lower pain thresholds than controls at the head (43.9 ℃ ± 3.2 ℃ vs. 45.1 ℃ ± 3.0 ℃, p = 0.015) and arm (43.2 ℃ ± 3.4 ℃ vs. 44.8 ℃ ± 3.3 ℃, p < 0.001). There were not significant correlations between pain thresholds and headache frequency or allodynia symptom severity. For the 41 migraineurs for whom time to next headache was known, there were positive correlations between time to next headache and pain thresholds at the head (r = 0.352, p = 0.024) and arm (r = 0.312, p = 0.047).
CONCLUSIONS:

This study provides evidence that migraineurs have low heat pain thresholds between migraine attacks. Mechanisms underlying these lower pain thresholds could also predispose migraineurs to their next migraine attack, a hypothesis supported by finding positive correlations between pain thresholds and time to next migraine attack.

Migraine and nosebleed in children case series and literature review.
Ahmed M1, Lam JW2.
Author information
Abstract

The presence of nose bleeding during a migraine attack as a single occurrence is so far rarely reported. Therefore, we have decided to report such occurrences we have noticed to further improve and build upon possible existing knowledge of such incidences.
METHOD:

728 children with an average age of 11.5 years, suffering from migraine were examined for nose bleeding. All structural, trauma, coagulation and medical causes were excluded. A computer-based literature search was also conducted to identify other cases of such sort.
RESULTS:

Eight cases (1.1%) of nose bleeding during attacks of migraine with no other known causes were identified. An additional 3 cases were identified in literature, though the presenting age was 25 years or above.
CONCLUSION:

In our case series, nose bleeding exclusively occurred during the attacks of headaches, although it was not considerably related to aura, frequency, location or intensity of migraine attacks. The presence of nose bleeding associated with migraine is an uncommon phenomenon and its mechanism is still unknown.

The relationship between dry eye and migraine.
Celikbilek A1, Adam M.
Author information
Abstract

Presently, migraine and dry eye are both thought to have an inflammatory pathogenesis. We aimed to investigate dry eye findings and any relationship with headache characteristics in migraine patients with and without aura. In total, 58 migraineurs and 41 age- and gender-matched controls were enrolled in this prospective clinical study. The migraine diagnosis was made according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders II diagnostic criteria. All patients underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination including tear meniscus measurements, meibography, tear breakup time, Schirmer test and the Ocular Surface Disease Index questionnaire. The presence of dry eye was higher in migraineurs as compared to the control group, but this did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.282). Among the headache characteristics, the presence of aura was significantly higher, and disease and attack durations were significantly longer in migraineurs with dry eye than in those without dry eye (p = 0.009, p = 0.010, and p = 0.003, respectively). In multiple logistic regression model, attack duration was found to be independently associated with the presence of dry eye in migraine patients (OR; 95 % CI; p = 0.029). The results show that dry eye may present in migraine patients with greater presence of auras and longer disease and attack durations.

Medium-term effectiveness of online behavioral training in migraine self-management: A randomized trial controlled over 10 months.
Sorbi MJ1, Kleiboer AM2, van Silfhout HG3, Vink G4, Passchier J5.
Author information
Abstract
AIM:

This randomized, controlled trial examined the medium-term effectiveness of online behavioral training in migraine self-management (oBT; N = 195) versus waitlist control (WLC; N = 173) on attack frequency, indicators of self-management (primary outcomes), headache top intensity, use of rescue medications, quality of life and disability (secondary outcomes).
METHODS:

An online headache diary following the ICHD-II and questionnaires were completed at baseline (T0), post-training (T1) and six months later (T2). Missing data (T1: 24%; T2: 37%) were handled by multiple imputation. We established effect sizes (ES) and tested between-group differences over time with linear mixed modelling techniques based on the intention-to-treat principle.
RESULTS:

At T2, attack frequency had improved significantly in oBT (-23%, ES = 0.66) but also in WLC (-19%; ES = 0.52). Self-efficacy, internal and external control in migraine management--and triptan use--improved only in oBT, however. This indicates different processes in both groups and could signify (the start of) active self-management in oBT. Also, only oBT improved migraine-specific quality of life to a sizable extent.
CONCLUSIONS:

oBT produced self-management gains but could not account for improved attack frequency, because WLC improved as well. The perspective that BT effects develop gradually, and that online delivery will boost BT outreach, justifies further research.

What efficacy measures are clinically relevant and should be used in Cochrane reviews of acute migraine trials? An alternative viewpoint.
Steiner TJ1.
Author information
Abstract

I briefly review the purposes of efficacy measures, which go far beyond supporting new drug development. I use vignettes to illustrate the importance of functional recovery during the migraine attack, and argue that headache relief provides this. Sustained headache relief (SHR) is therefore a very worthwhile outcome when the alternative is a day of debilitating pain. As a measure, SHR may not be ideal for new drug development but it is informative to individuals, health care providers and politicians, and serves cost-effectiveness analysis better than any other. Cochrane are absolutely right to use it in systematic reviews along with the IHS-recommended measures.

Central effects of acetylsalicylic acid on trigeminal-nociceptive stimuli.
Kröger IL, May A1.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Acetylsalicylic acid is one of the most used analgesics to treat an acute migraine attack. Next to the inhibitory effects on peripheral prostaglandin synthesis, central mechanisms of action have also been discussed.
METHODS:

Using a standardized model for trigeminal-nociceptive stimulation during fMRI scanning, we investigated the effect of acetylsalicylic acid on acute pain compared to saline in 22 healthy volunteers in a double-blind within-subject design. Painful stimulation was applied using gaseous ammonia and presented in a pseudo-randomized order with several control stimuli. All participants were instructed to rate the intensity and unpleasantness of every stimulus on a VAS scale. Based on previous results, we hypothesized to find an effect of ASA on central pain processing structures like the ACC, SI and SII as well as the trigeminal nuclei and the hypothalamus.
RESULTS:

Even though we did not find any differences in pain ratings between saline and ASA, we observed decreased BOLD signal changes in response to trigemino-nociceptive stimulation in the ACC and SII after administration of ASA compared to saline. This finding is in line with earlier imaging results investigating the effect of ASA on acute pain. Contrary to earlier findings from animal studies, we could not find an effect of ASA on the trigeminal nuclei in the brainstem or within the hypothalamic area.
CONCLUSION:

Taken together our study replicates earlier findings of an attenuating effect of ASA on pain processing structures, which adds further evidence to a possibly central mechanism of action of ASA.

What turns on a migraine? A systematic review of migraine precipitating factors.
Peroutka SJ1.
Author information
Abstract

Migraine attacks rarely occur spontaneously in the absence of any possible precipitating factors. A systematic literature review of 25 publications revealed a consistent set of stimuli that have been identified as factors associated with the onset of a migraine attack. The weighted average of the "Top 10" trigger factors was determined. Stress was cited as the overall most common migraine precipitating factor, which was identified as a trigger factor by 58 % of 7187 migraineurs. The incidence of migraine precipitating factors, across various populations globally, demonstrates the clinical consistency of migraine in the human population. Future efforts aimed at mitigating these precipitating factors have the potential to significantly improve migraine management. However, the current healthcare system is unlikely to be able to develop detailed personalized management plans. There is a need to develop a novel approach to the identification and management of multiple trigger factors in individual migraineurs.
