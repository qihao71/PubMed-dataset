# PubMed-dataset
This is a new benchmark dataset for relation extraction task, which consists of 600 sentences extracted from PubMed. PubMed consists of more than 26 million publications from the MEDLINE bibliographic database, life science journals, and on-line books. PubMed also includes the full text of the biomedical articles, including their abstracts. Each record contains a PubMed ID (PMID), the title of the article and its abstract in plain text format, ready to be analysed by NLP tools. 

362 abstracts about "cancer"(162) "magnesium deficiency" (150) and "migraine attack" (50) as keyword search from PubMed were randomly selected. A typical abstract contained roughly 8-10 sentences and the dataset contains approximately 3000 sentences. From these 300 abstracts, we construct the PubMed dataset by randomly selecting 600 sentences. These sentences were manually annotated by us and a biochemistry graduate student. 1545 biomedical named entities were annotated, including protein, DNA, RNA, body part and cell type. To define whether a word is a biomedical entity, UMLS were used as a dictionary. 996 relationships between these biomedical named entities were annotated.

This new benchmark dataset is publicaly available for Named Entity Recognition task and relation extraction task.
