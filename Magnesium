Abstract

Migraine is one of the most common recurrent types of headache and is the seventh cause of disability. This neurological disorder is characterized by having pain in head and other various symptoms such as nausea, emesis, photophobia, phonophobia, and sometimes visual sensory disorders. Magnesium (Mg) is a necessary ion for human body and has a crucial role in health and life maintenance. One of the main roles of Mg is to conserve neurons electric potential. Therefore, magnesium deficiency can cause neurological complications. Migraine is usually related to low amounts of Mg in serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Deficits in magnesium have significant role in the pathogenesis of migraine. Mg has been extensively used in migraine prophylaxis and treatment. This review summarizes the role of Mg in migraine pathogenesis and the potential utilizations of Mg in the prevention and treatment of migraine with the emphasis on transdermal magnesium delivery.

Abstract

Magnesium is a vital cation that takes part in many cellular processes. Magnesium balance can be disturbed in multiple conditions, and differences in magnesium concentration can be responsible for numerous physiological and pathological processes. Magnesium deficiency is commonly associated with liver diseases, and may result from low nutrient uptake, greater urinary secretion, low serum albumin concentration, or hormone inactivation. In turn, low magnesium content in serum and liver tissue can lead to the progression of these diseases, due to a disruption in mitochondrial function, defective protein kinase C (PKC) translocation, inflammatory responses, oxidative stress, or metabolic disorders. Furthermore, magnesium supplementation can improve liver function in certain liver diseases. This paper comprehensively reviews the changes in magnesium concentrations associated with liver cirrhosis, alcoholic liver disease (ALD), liver cancer, and viral hepatitis, and explains how such changes may in turn impact these disease processes.

Abstract

Magnesium, one of the basic elements for the human body, is necessary for many physiological functions. Magnesium deficiency is widely observed as a result of the reduced nutrient content of foods, over-cooking, diseases, drugs, alcohol, and caffeine consumption. Taking a dietary supplement is necessary magnesium deficiency. It has been demonstrated that absorption of organic magnesium compounds is better than absorption of inorganic compounds. The aim of this study is to investigate transitions to tissues of different organic magnesium compounds in different doses and whether there is a difference in the organic acid-bounded compounds (magnesium citrate and magnesium malate) and the amino acid-bounded compounds (magnesium acetyl taurate and magnesium glycinate), associated with transition and bioavailability. In addition, the effects of split dosages of high doses in a high volume of solvent on tissue magnesium levels are being investigated, because galenic formulation problems are regarded to prepare convenient dosage that can be taken once a day. All magnesium compounds were administered as three different doses, 45, 135, and 405 mg/70 kg elemental magnesium, were given per orally to Balbc mice. In a second set of experiments, 405 mg/70 kg high dose was divided into two doses of 202.5 mg/70 kg each and administered every 12 h. Brain, muscle tissues, and serum magnesium levels measured in all experimental groups and control 24 h later. Brain magnesium levels were found increased in all magnesium acetyl taurate administered subjects. Magnesium citrate increased muscle and brain magnesium levels in a dose-independent manner. We showed that dividing high doses of daily administered magnesium compounds did not sufficiently increase tissue magnesium levels. Although passive paracellular mechanism by solvent drag is the main mechanism of Mg absorption, other factors (electrochemical gradient effects, transcellular transporter mechanisms, magnesium status) should be effective on our results. It is necessary for further research on long-term administration of different magnesium compounds and their effect on other tissues.

Abstract

Decreased bone mass and an increased risk of bone fractures become more common with age. This condition is often associated with osteoporosis and is caused by an imbalance of bone resorption and new bone formation. Lifestyle factors that affect the risk of osteoporosis include alcohol, diet, hormones, physical activity, and smoking. Calcium and vitamin D are particularly important for the age-related loss of bone density and skeletal muscle mass, but other minerals, such as magnesium, also have an important role. Here, we summarize how optimal magnesium and vitamin D balance improve health outcomes in the elderly, the role of magnesium and vitamin D on bone formation, and the implications of widespread deficiency of these factors in the United States and worldwide, particularly in the elderly population.

Abstract

Klotho knock-out mice are an important model for vascular calcification, which is associated with chronic kidney disease. In chronic kidney disease, serum magnesium inversely correlates with vascular calcification. Here we determine the effects of serum magnesium on aortic calcification in Klotho knock-out mice treated with a minimal or a high magnesium diet from birth. After eight weeks, serum biochemistry and aorta and bone tissues were studied. Protective effects of magnesium were characterized by RNA-sequencing of the aorta and micro-CT analysis was performed to study bone integrity. A high magnesium diet prevented vascular calcification and aortic gene expression of Runx2 and matrix Gla protein found in such mice on the minimal magnesium diet. Differential expression of inflammation and extracellular matrix remodeling genes accompanied the beneficial effects of magnesium on calcification. High dietary magnesium did not affect serum parathyroid hormone, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 or calcium. High magnesium intake prevented vascular calcification despite increased fibroblast growth factor-23 and phosphate concentration in the knock-out mice. Compared to mice on the minimal magnesium diet, the high magnesium diet reduced femoral bone mineral density by 20% and caused excessive osteoid formation indicating osteomalacia. Osteoclast activity was unaffected by the high magnesium diet. In Saos-2 osteoblasts, magnesium supplementation reduced mineralization independent of osteoblast function. Thus, high dietary magnesium prevents calcification in Klotho knock-out mice. These effects are potentially mediated by reduction of inflammatory and extracellular matrix remodeling pathways within the aorta. Hence magnesium treatment may be promising to prevent vascular calcification, but the risk for osteomalacia should be considered.

Abstract

Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a wide number of abnormalities in mineral metabolism. Often, these alterations are the leading players in the development of comorbidities associated with CKD, which are risk factors of mortality. In this context, mineral and bone disorder associated with CKD (CKD-MBD) are highlighted, connecting bone, renal, and cardiovascular disorders. Many studies have been led to propose strategies to avoid, reduce, or slow down CKD-MBD progression using different compositions of metallic elements-based P binders such as aluminum, magnesium, or calcium. Magnesium, the aim of this review, has been used by nephrologists to treat CKD-MBD with a variable acceptation due mainly to different results on bone homeostasis. Nowadays, we have new evidence about the efficacy of magnesium supplementation on vascular calcification, renal function, and bone disorders, suggesting potential beneficial effects of Magnesium in the management of CKD-MBD.

Abstract

Prevention of type 2 diabetes (T2D) with diet or diet supplementation is challenging. This article aims to draw conclusive associations between magnesium intake and T2D incidence and evaluate the effect of magnesium supplementation on glucose metabolism. Databases were searched for related articles from inception to May 15, 2019. Prospective cohort studies investigating the relevant relationship as well as randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effect of magnesium supplementation were eligible. We conducted trial sequential analysis (TSA) to prove the sufficiency of the current evidence. Twenty-six publications involving 35 cohorts were included in the analysis. Compared to the lowest magnesium intake, the highest level was associated with a 22% lower risk for T2D; the risk was reduced by 6% for each 100 mg increment in daily magnesium intake. Additional analysis of 26 RCTs (1168 participants) was performed, revealing that magnesium supplementation significantly reduced the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level (SMD, -0.32 [95% CI, -0.59 to -0.05], 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test (2-h OGTT) result (SMD, -0.30 [-0.58 to -0.02]), fasting insulin level (SMD, -0.17 [-0.30 to -0.04]), homeostatic model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) score (SMD, -0.41 [-0.71 to -0.11]), triglyceride (TG) level, systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). TSA showed an inverse association, with most benefits of magnesium supplementation on glucose metabolism being stable. In conclusion, magnesium intake has an inverse dose-response association with T2D incidence, and supplementation appears to be advisable in terms of glucose parameters in T2D/high-risk individuals.

Abstract

Biodegradability and mechanical properties of magnesium alloys are attractive for orthopaedic and cardiovascular applications. In order to study their cytotoxicity usually bone cells are used. However, after implantation, diverse and versatile cells are recruited and interact. Among the first ones coming into play are cells of the immune system, which are responsible for the inflammatory reaction. Macrophages play a central role in the inflammatory process due to the production of cytokines involved in the tissue healing but also in the possible failure of the implants. In order to evaluate the in vitro influence of the degradation products of magnesium-based alloys on cytokine release, the extracts of pure magnesium and two magnesium alloys (with gadolinium and silver as alloying elements) were examined in an inflammatory in vitro model. Human promonocytic cells (U937 cells) were differentiated into macrophages and further cultured with magnesium-based extracts for 1 and 3 days (simulating early and late inflammatory reaction phases), either at 37 °C or at 39 °C (mimicking normal and inflammatory conditions, respectively). All extracts exhibit very good cytocompatibility on differentiated macrophages. Results suggest that M1 and even more M2 profiles of macrophage were stimulated by the extracts of Mg. Furthermore, Mg-10Gd and Mg-2Ag extracts introduced a nuancing effect by rather inhibiting macrophage M1 profile. Magnesium-based biomaterials could thus induce a faster inflammation resolution while improving tissue repair. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Macrophage are the key-cells during inflammation and can influence the fate of tissue healing and implant performance. Magnesium-based implants are biodegradable and bioactive. Here we selected an in vitro system to model early and late inflammation and effect of pyrexia (37 °C versus 39 °C). We showed the beneficial and nuancing effects of magnesium (Mg) and the selected alloying elements (silver (Ag) and gadolinium (Gd)) on the macrophage polarisation. Mg extracts exacerbated simultaneously the macrophage M1 and M2 profiles while Mg-2Ag and Mg-10Gd rather inhibited the M1 differentiation. Furthermore, 39 °C exhibited protective effect by either decreasing cytokine production or promoting anti-inflammatory ones, with or without extracts. Mg-based biomaterials could thus induce a faster inflammation resolution while improving tissue repair.

Abstract

Magnesium (Mg2+) is one of the major elements required to maintain normal metabolism and ionic balances in ocular tissues. The physiological role of Mg2+ is mediated through maintaining the Na+-K+-ATPase on membrane, favoring energy-generating reactions, replication of DNA and protein synthesis. Despite the wide availability of this element, hypomagnesemia has been associated with many human ailments. Recent studies highlighted the association of hypomagnesemia and, thereby, supplementation of Mg2+ in the management of eye diseases. Glaucoma, senile cataract and diabetic retinopathy were associated with low level of extracellular Mg2+. The neurovascular protective effects of Mg2+ mediated through activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase and inhibition of endothelin-1 eventually result in vasodilatation of retinal vessels. Mg2+ can maintain the lens sodium pump activity and antioxidant status and block the calcium channels and release of glutamate in nerve endings. Furthermore, it can prevent the apoptosis of retinal ganglion cells. All these effects contribute to its being a pharmacological agent against ocular diseases. However, clinical trials are scant. This article discusses the role of Mg2+ as a possible therapeutic agent in the management of glaucoma, cataract and diabetic retinopathy.

Excerpt

Magnesium is a mineral that is naturally found in your body and in the food you consume daily. It is responsible for many processes within your body that includes, but not limited to, protein synthesis, bone formation, blood pressure regulation, nerve function, and electrical conduction in the heart. However, too much magnesium, whether it’s due to over-consumption or under-excretion, can result in serious health issues for the patient. This activity will cover the causes, as well as the early symptomatic presentation of magnesium toxicity. Additionally, it will highlight the importance of diagnosing and treating magnesium toxicity early on and how a strong interprofessional effort is important to prevent fatal complications.

Abstract

Magnesium supplementation is often suggested for restless legs syndrome (RLS) or period limb movement disorder (PLMD) based on anecdotal evidence that it relieves symptoms and because it is also commonly recommended for leg cramps. We aimed to review all articles reporting the effects of magnesium supplementation on changes in RLS and/or PLMD. We conducted a systematic search looking for all relevant articles and then two reviewers read all article titles and abstracts to identify relevant studies. Eligible studies were scored for their quality as interventional trials. We found 855 abstracts and 16 of these could not be definitively excluded for not addressing all aspects of our research question. Seven full-text articles were unlocatable and one was ineligible which left eight studies with relevant data. One was a randomised placebo-controlled trial, three were case series and four were case studies. The RCT did not find a significant treatment effect of magnesium but may have been underpowered. After quality appraisal and synthesis of the evidence we were unable to make a conclusion as to the effectiveness of magnesium for RLS/PLMD. It is not clear whether magnesium helps relieve RLS or PLMD or in which patient groups any benefit might be seen.

Abstract

The aims of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of magnesium alginate in decreasing functional regurgitation symptoms in infants, and to assess the cost-benefit ratio of magnesium alginate compared to a thickened formula. A multicenter perspective cross-over study was conducted in formula-fed infants with persisting regurgitation, randomly assigned to receive two weeks of a magnesium-alginate-based formulation followed by two weeks of thickened formula, or vice-versa. Infants, exclusively breast-fed, were followed up for two weeks while receiving magnesium alginate. Symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux (GER) were evaluated through the Infant Gastroesophageal Reflux Questionnaire Revised (I-GERQ-R). Direct cost of treatments was also calculated. Seventy-two infants completed the study. We found a significant reduction of I-GERQ-R scores over time (F = 55.387; p < 0.001) in all groups with no difference between the sequences of administration (F = 0.268; p = 0.848) in formula-fed infants and between exclusively breast-fed and formula-fed infants receiving magnesium alginate (t = 1.55; p = 0.126). The mean cost savings per infant was € 4.60 (±11.2) in formula-fed infants treated with magnesium alginate compared to thickened formula (t = 2.91, p < 0.0005). Conclusions were that the magnesium-alginate formulation reduces GER symptoms both in formula-fed and breast-fed infants. In formula-fed infants, clinical efficacy is similar to thickened formulas with a slightly lower cost of treatment.

Abstract

In terms of antinociceptive action, the main mode of action of magnesium involves its antagonist action at the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, which prevents central sensitization and attenuates preexisting pain hypersensitivity. Given the pivotal function of NMDA receptors in pain transduction, magnesium has been investigated in a variety of pain conditions. The oral and parenteral administration of magnesium via the intravenous, intrathecal, or epidural route may alleviate pain and perioperative anesthetic and analgesic requirements. These beneficial effects of magnesium therapy have also been reported in patients with neuropathic pain, such as malignancy-related neurologic symptoms, diabetic neuropathy, postherpetic neuralgia, and chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy. In addition, magnesium treatment is reportedly able to alleviate fibromyalgia, dysmenorrhea, headaches, and acute migraine attacks. Although magnesium plays an evolving role in pain management, better understanding of the mechanism underlying its antinociceptive action and additional clinical studies is required to clarify its role as an adjuvant analgesic.

Abstract

Magnesium (Mg2+ ), as a main component of bone, is widely applied to promote bone growth and regeneration. However, Mg2+ can chemically inhibit the crystallization of amorphous calcium phosphate into hydroxyapatite (HA). The underlying mechanisms by which Mg2+ improves bone biomineralization remain elusive. Here, it is demonstrated that Mg2+ plays dual roles in bone biomineralization from a developmental perspective. During embryonic development, the Mg2+ concentration is enriched in the early stage from embryonic day 13.5 (E13.5) to E15.5, but gradually decreases to a stable state in the late phase, after E15.5. Appropriate concentrations of Mg2+ can promote the mineralization of bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells, while excessive Mg2+ impairs their osteogenesis. The earlier the Mg2+ is added, the stronger the observed inhibition of mineralization. In particular, less Mg2+ is present in fully mineralized collagen than in poorly mineralized collagen. Furthermore, a high concentration of Mg2+ changes the crystalline morphology of HA and inhibits collagen calcification. Functionally, a high-Mg2+ diet inhibits bone biomineralization in mouse offspring. Taken together, the results suggest that appropriate regulation of Mg2+ concentration over time is vital for normal biomineralization. This study is significant for the future design of bone substitutes and implants associated with Mg2+ content.

Abstract

Magnesium is an important element that has essential roles in the regulation of cell growth, division, and differentiation. Mounting evidence in the literature suggests an association between hypomagnesemia and all-cause mortality. In addition, epidemiologic studies have demonstrated that a diet poor in magnesium increases the risk of developing cancer, highlighting its importance in the field of hematology and oncology. In solid malignancies, hypomagnesemia at diagnosis portends a worse prognosis. However, little is known about prognosis in patients with hypomagnesemia and blood cancers in general; lymphoma more specifically. Hypomagnesemia has been associated with a higher viral load of the Epstein Barr virus, a virus associated with a multitude of hematologic malignancies. The role of magnesium in the immune system has been further elucidated in studies of patients with a rare primary immunodeficiency known as XMEN disease (X-linked immunodeficiency with Magnesium defect, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, and Neoplasia disease). These patients have a mutation in the MAGT1 gene, which codes for a magnesium transporter. The mutation leads to impaired T cell activation and an increased risk of developing hematologic malignancies. In this review we discuss the relevance of magnesium as an electrolyte, current measurement techniques, and the known data related to cause and prognosis of blood cancers. The goal is to use these data to stimulate additional high-quality and well powered studies to further investigate the role of magnesium in preventing cancer and improving outcomes of patients with malignancy and concomitant magnesium deficiency.

Abstract

Background: The quantitative association between serum/dietary magnesium and cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains unclear. We conducted a dose-response meta-analysis to evaluate the quantitative association between serum/dietary magnesium and CVD, including coronary heart disease (CHD).

Methods: PubMed, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Web of Science were searched for publications. STATA 12.0 was used to analyze data. We used the random-effects model to reduce heterogeneity.

Results: Eighteen prospective cohort studies with 544,581 participants and 22,658 CVD cases were included. The follow-up duration was 1-28 years. The pooled relative risk (RR) of CVD for the relatively normal versus lowest serum and dietary magnesium level was 0.64 {[95% confidence interval (CI): 0.51-0.80] and 0.90 [95% CI: 0.84-0.96]}. The pooled RR of CHD for the relatively normal versus lowest serum and dietary magnesium level was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.57-0.85) and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.77-0.94). We noted a significant association between increasing serum magnesium levels (per 0.1-mg/dL increase) and risk of CVD (RR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.88-0.97) and CHD (RR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.84-0.96) and between dietary magnesium levels (per 100-mg/d increase) and risk of CVD (RR: 0.90, 95% CI: 0.83-0.96) and CHD (RR: 0.92, 95% CI: 0.82-0.98). Serum/dietary Mg level comparisons presented a 7%-10% decrease in CVD/CHD risk. The dose-response meta-analyses showed linear relationships between serum magnesium and CVD (Pnonlinearity = 0.833) or CHD (Pnonlinearity = 0.193) and dietary magnesium and CVD (Pnonlinearity = 0.463) or CHD (Pnonlinearity = 0.440).

Abstract

Since October 8, 2013, the second-generation drug-eluting resorbable magnesium scaffold (RMS) has been used to treat coronary lesions. At present, the second-generation drug-eluting RMS is clinically available in Europe, some South American countries, and some Asian and African countries. Furthermore, patients are currently being enrolled in ongoing post-marketing trials. This device has the potential to be an alternative to drug-eluting stents in the future, but there is not yet sufficient evidence. This review provides the latest available evidence, comparison with other bioresorbable scaffolds, future perspectives, and discussion of clinical case reports with second-generation drug-eluting RMS. SUMMARY: Favorable outcomes have been reported after second-generation drug-eluting RMS implantation. More long-term clinical outcomes for this novel device are still required in the future.

Abstract

The impact of magnesium on risk of knee osteoarthritis (KOE) is still under investigation. This meta-analysis evaluated the relationship between magnesium and risk of KOE.A comprehensive search was performed to identify retrospective cohort study or cross-sectional study of the association between magnesium and KOE from the Cochrane library, PubMed, and Embase. The search time limit was from the establishment of the database to December 2018. Two evaluators selected the literature, extracted the data, and evaluated the quality of the literature according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria, independently. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.3 software and publication bias was assessed using Begg and Egger test and funnel plot.Finally, 6 studies were included with a total of 15,715 participants. Although higher daily intake of magnesium was associated with a significantly reduced risk of fracture in patients with KOE (OR = 0.66, 95%CI: 0.56, 0.78; P < .00001), it was not significant for lowering the risk of KOE (OR = 0.80; 95% CI: 0.61, 1.04; P = .1). Meta-analysis also showed that population with higher serum magnesium levels had significantly lower risk of KOE (odds ratio (OR) = 0.84; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.72, 0.98; P = .03). Further subgroup analysis showed that the relationship between serum magnesium level and KOE risk was significantly affected by serum magnesium level (P = .006 for quartiles 4 vs 1).Higher level of magnesium intake was not associated with lower risk of KOE. However, higher daily intake of magnesium may be inversely associated with risk of fracture in KOE patients.

Abstract

Introduction: Non-traumatic headaches comprise up to 4% of all emergency department (ED) visits. Current practice is moving toward multimodal analgesia regimens that limit narcotic use.

Objective: The objective of this systematic review is to address the following research question: In patients with non-traumatic headaches (Population), does administration of intravenous magnesium sulfate (Intervention) compared to placebo, corticosteroids, dopamine antagonists, ergot alkaloids, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), triptans, or usual care result in better pain control, lower rate of recurrence at 24 hours, lower requirements for rescue analgesia, and less adverse medication effects (Outcomes)?

Methods: Scholarly databases and relevant bibliographies were searched, as were clinical trial registries and relevant conference proceedings to limit publication bias. Studies were not limited by date, language, or publication status. Inclusion criteria were: (1) randomized clinical trial (RCT), (2) patients age ≥18 years, (3) non-traumatic headache, (4) patients treated in ED or an outpatient acute care treatment center, and (5) magnesium sulfate administered intravenously (IV). Eligible comparison groups included: placebo, conventional therapy, dopamine antagonist, NSAID, corticosteroid, ergot alkaloid, or triptans.

Results: Out of 4018 identified references, 7 RCTs (545 participants) that treated migraine headaches (n = 6) and benign non-traumatic headaches (n = 1) met inclusion criteria. Pain intensity was improved with magnesium sulfate vs comparators at 60-120 minutes, but not at earlier time points. Result for the endpoint of pain reduction by 50% were conflicting as 3 studies reported that headache was improved, unchanged, and less with magnesium sulfate. Complete pain relief was improved with magnesium sulfate in 1 study, and in the migraine with aura (MA) subgroup in another. The need for rescue analgesia at any point was improved with magnesium sulfate in 1 study, and in the MA subgroup in another. Twenty-four-hour headache recurrence was improved with magnesium sulfate in 1 study, but unchanged in a second. The intended meta-analysis was not performed due to the clinical heterogeneity among studies.

Conclusion: While we cannot draw a firm conclusion on the efficacy or benefit of intravenous magnesium sulfate in the treatment of acute non-traumatic headaches, the existing evidence indicates potential benefits in pain control beyond 1 hour, aura duration, and need for rescue analgesia.

Abstract

Aim: We aimed to examine the association between serum magnesium and diabetes and hypertension among Qatari adults.

Methods: In the cross-sectional study, we used data from 9693 Qatari participants aged 20 years and above attending the Qatar Biobank (QBB) Study. Blood samples were analyzed in a central lab. Habitual food consumption was assessed by a food frequency questionnaire. Reduced rank regression was used to construct magnesium related dietary pattern (MRDP) using serum magnesium as a response variable. Diabetes was defined by blood glucose, HbA1c or known diabetes. Prediabetes was defined as HbA1c between 5.7% and 6.4%. Subclinical magnesium deficiency was defined as serum magnesium <0.85 mmol/L.

Results: The prevalence of diabetes, prediabetes and subclinical magnesium deficiency was 18.9%, 11.5% and 59.5%, respectively. Across the quartiles of serum magnesium from high to low, the prevalence ratios (PR 95%CI) for diabetes were 1.00, 1.35, 1.88, and 2.70 (95%CI 2.38-3.05), respectively (p for trend <0.001). The presence of hypertension significantly increased the probability of diabetes along a wide range of low serum magnesium. A low intake of MRDP was also positively associated with diabetes and high HbA1c.

Conclusion: Subclinical magnesium deficiency is common in Qatar and associates with diabetes, prediabetes and hypertension in Qatari adults.

Abstract

Background High values of endogenous levels of magnesium (Mg) in the body and mechanisms of homeostasis regulation make it difficult to assess the bioavailability of these drugs. The aim of this study was to assess the Mg concentration in blood in volunteers and in erythrocytes in patients with hypomagnesemia. Methods The study included 20 healthy volunteers and 62 patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) I-III functional class (FC) NYHA classification. We studied the composition of Mgorotate and Mgorotate plus potassium (К)orotate. Blood sampling was carried out at 8 a.m. and within 10 h after administering the drugs. Measurement of Mg pharmacokinetic parameters: AUC (concentration of the active substance-time), and Cmax (maximum concentration) in volunteers and measurement of the concentration of Mg in erythrocytes of patients. Results The results indicated that both the AUC in volunteers and concentration of Mg in erythrocytes of patients are comparable, and the differences are not statistically significant. Conclusions The study showed that the standard method of calculating the AUC (total serum Mg) is insufficient for comparative evaluation of Mg absorption due to the high levels of its endogenous content and a small increase in concentration after taking the drugs. It is advisable to assess the concentration of Mg in the red blood cells of patients.

Abstract

Magnesium plays a critical role in athlete health and performance. It is involved in numerous physiological mechanisms that support energy production, immune function, pain modulation, muscle function and bone health. Athletes may be susceptible to magnesium deficiency due to an increased utilization during exercise.Objective: This study reports on the magnesium status of 192 Olympic and Paralympic athletes over the course of eight years.Methods: Athletes on the British Athletics world class performance plan undertook blood testing for Red Cell Magnesium status. Their history of tendon pain, muscle and bone injury, ethnicity, sporting event and gender were also recorded. 510 samples from 192 athletes were included in the study.Results: On at least one blood test during the study time, 22% of athletes were identified as clinically deficient (<1.19 mmol/L). The average red cell magnesium concentration was 1.34 nmol/L. Magnesium was significantly lower in female athletes and those with Black or Mixed-Race ethnicity and was higher in Throws athletes and Paralympians with Cerebral Palsy. Athletes with a history of achilles or patella tendon pain had significantly lower magnesium levels than average.Conclusions: This study highlights the importance of investigating magnesium within this population to identify deficiency and support athlete health. Several areas for future work are identified to explore the relationship between magnesium and gender, ethnicity and tendon pain and muscle injury in athletes. Furthermore, new guidelines for magnesium status within athletics populations are proposed.

Abstract

The pleiotropic host resistance factor SLC11A1 (NRAMP1) defends against diverse intracellular pathogens in mammals by yet-unknown mechanisms. We compared Salmonella infection of coisogenic mice with different SLC11A1 alleles. SLC11A1 reduced Salmonella replication and triggered up-regulation of uptake systems for divalent metal cations but no other stress responses. SLC11A1 modestly diminished iron availability and acutely restricted Salmonella access to magnesium. Growth of Salmonella cells in the presence of SLC11A1 was highly heterogeneous and inversely correlated with expression of the crucial magnesium transporter gene mgtB We observed superimposable single-cell patterns in mice lacking SLC11A1 when we restricted Salmonella access to magnesium by impairing its uptake. Together, these findings identify deprivation of the main group metal magnesium as the main resistance mechanism of SLC11A1 against Salmonella.

Abstract

The titanium (Ti) implant is widely used in implant dentistry; yet peri-implantitis has always been one of the most common and serious complications. Here, we demonstrated that magnesium-doping would be an effective way of enhancing the integration between implant surfaces and gingival tissues, which is critical to peri-implant health. The magnesium (2.76-6.35 at %) was immobilized onto the titanium substrate by a magnesium plasma immersion ion implantation (Mg-PIII) technique. Mg-PIII treatments did not alter surface topographies of the original titanium substrate but improved its hydrophilicity. The in vitro study including cell viability, adhesion, proliferation, migration, and real-time polymerase chain reaction assays disclosed improved adhesion, proliferation, migration, and extracellular matrix remodeling abilities of human gingival fibroblasts (HGFs) on the magnesium-doped titanium. The results of western blot suggested that the Mg-modified titanium induced the phosphorylation of AKT through the activation of PI3K. Our results revealed that magnesium-doping would potentially enhance soft tissue sealings by promoting cellular functions of HGFs in a dose-dependent manner, boding well for its applications on surfaces of implant necks in early peri-implant soft tissue integrations.

Abstract

Introduction: Magnesium is an essential cation involved in many functions within the central nervous system, including transmission and intracellular signal transduction. Several studies have shown its usefulness in neurological and psychiatric diseases. Furthermore, it seems that magnesium levels are lowered in the course of several mental disorders, especially depression.

Objectives: In this study, we wish to evaluate the presence of a relationship between the levels of magnesium and the presence of psychiatric pathology as well as the effectiveness of magnesium as a therapeutic supplementation.

Methods: A systematic search of scientific records concerning magnesium in psychiatric disorders published from 2010 up to March 2020 was performed. We collected a total of 32 articles: 18 on Depressive Disorders (DD), four on Anxiety Disorders (AD), four on Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), three on Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD), one on Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), one on Schizophrenia (SCZ) and one on Eating Disorders (ED).

Results: Twelve studies highlighted mainly positive results in depressive symptoms. Seven showed a significant correlation between reduced plasma magnesium values and depression measured with psychometric scales. Two papers reported improved depressive symptoms after magnesium intake, two in association with antidepressants, compared to controls. No significant association between magnesium serum levels and panic or Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) patients, in two distinct papers, was found. In two other papers, a reduced Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) score in depressed patients correlated with higher levels of magnesium and beneficial levels of magnesium in stressed patients was found. Two papers reported low levels of magnesium in association with ADHD. Only one of three papers showed lower levels of magnesium in ASD. ED and SCZ reported a variation in magnesium levels in some aspects of the disease.

Conclusion: The results are not univocal, both in terms of the plasma levels and of therapeutic effects. However, from the available evidence, it emerged that supplementation with magnesium could be beneficial. Therefore, it is necessary to design ad hoc clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of magnesium alone or together with other drugs (antidepressants) in order to establish the correct use of this cation with potential therapeutic effects.

Abstract

Purpose: Magnesium supplementation modulates glucose metabolism and inflammation, which could influence exercise performance and recovery. This study investigated the effect of magnesium intake on physiological responses and performance during eccentric exercise and recovery.

Methods: Nine male recreational runners completed a counterbalanced, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, registered at ClinicalTrial.gov. Participants consumed low magnesium diets and were supplemented with 500 mg/day of magnesium (SUP) or placebo (CON) for 7 days prior to a 10 km downhill (- 10%) running time trial (TT), separated by a 2-week washout period. At baseline and 24 h post-TT, maximal muscle force was measured. Interleukin-6 (IL-6), soluble interleukin-6 receptor (sIL-6R) and creatine kinase (CK) were measured at rest, 0 h, 1 h and 24 h post-TT. Muscle soreness was measured at the previous times plus 48 h and 72 h post. Glucose and lactate were measured during the TT.

Results: The main effect of condition was detected for IL-6 (SUP: 1.36 ± 0.66 vs CON: 2.06 ± 1.14 pg/ml) (P < 0.05, η2 = 0.54), sIL-6R (SUP: 27,615 ± 8446 vs CON: 24,368 ± 7806 pg/ml) (P < 0.05, η2 = 0.41) and muscle soreness (P < 0.01, η2 = 0.67). Recovery of blood glucose and muscle soreness were enhanced in SUP post-TT. There were no differences in glucose and lactate during the TT, or post measures of CK and maximal muscle force.

Conclusion: Magnesium supplementation reduced the IL-6 response, enhanced recovery of blood glucose, and muscle soreness after strenuous exercise, but did not improve performance or functional measures of recovery.

Abstract

Magnesium sulfate is the anticonvulsant of choice for eclampsia prophylaxis and treatment; however, the recommended dosing regimens are costly and cumbersome and can be administered only by skilled health professionals. The objectives of this study were to develop a robust exposure-response model for the relationship between serum magnesium exposure and eclampsia using data from large studies of women with preeclampsia who received magnesium sulfate, and to predict eclampsia probabilities for standard and alternative (shorter treatment duration and/or fewer intramuscular injections) regimens. Exposure-response modeling and simulation were applied to existing data. A total of 10 280 women with preeclampsia who received magnesium sulfate or placebo were evaluated. An existing population pharmacokinetic model was used to estimate individual serum magnesium exposure. Logistic regression was applied to quantify the serum magnesium area under the curve-eclampsia rate relationship. Our exposure-response model-estimated eclampsia rates were comparable to observed rates. Several alternative regimens predicted magnesium peak concentration < 3.5 mmol/L (empiric safety threshold) and eclampsia rate ≤ 0.7% (observed response threshold), including 4 g intravenously plus 10 g intramuscularly followed by either 8 g intramuscularly every 6 hours × 3 doses or 10 g intramuscularly every 8 hours × 2 doses and 10 g intramuscularly every 8 hours × 3 doses. Several alternative magnesium sulfate regimens with comparable model-predicted efficacy and safety were identified that merit evaluation in confirmatory clinical trials.

Abstract

In the process of bone tissue engineering, the osteoimmunomodulatory property of biomaterials is very important for osteogenic differentiation of stem cells, which determines the outcome of bone regeneration. Magnesium (Mg) is a biodegradable, biocompatible metal that has osteoconductive properties and has been regarded as a promising bone biomaterial. However, the high degradation rate of Mg leads to excessive inflammation, thereby restricting its application in bone tissue engineering. Importantly, different coatings or magnesium alloys have been utilized to lower the rate of degradation. In fact, a prior study proved that β-TCP coating of Mg scaffolds can modulate the osteoimmunomodulatory properties of Mg-based biomaterials and create a favorable immune microenvironment for osteogenesis. However, the osteoimmunomodulatory properties of Mg ions themselves have not been explored yet. In this study, the osteoimmunomodulatory properties of Mg ions with involvement of macrophages and bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) were systematically investigated. Microscale Mg ions (100 mg/L) were found to possess osteoimmunomodulatory properties that favor bone formation. Specifically, microscale Mg ions induced M2 phenotype changes of macrophages and the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines by inhibiting the TLR-NF-κB signaling pathway. Microscale Mg ions also stimulated the expression of osteoinductive molecules in macrophages while Mg ions/macrophage-conditioned medium promoted osteogenesis of BMSCs through the BMP/SMAD signaling pathway. These findings indicate that manipulating Mg ion concentration can endow the Mg biomaterial with favorable osteoimmunomodulatory properties, thereby providing fundamental evidence for improving and modifying the effect of Mg-based bone biomaterials.

Abstract

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the most important regulator of angiogenesis which serves to provide sufficient blood supply, and can trigger both physiological and pathological angiogenesis. Recent studies have shown that VEGF increases in gynecological diseases (such as endometriosis, ovarian, and endometrial cancers) and is a prognostic factor in these pathologies. Therefore, VEGF should be maintained at appropriate levels. Magnesium is used in many gynecological practices (such as eclampsia, preeclampsia, dysmenorrhea, and climacteric symptoms) and the mechanisms of action are still under investigation. Redox status, which can be regulated by magnesium, was shown to affect VEGF expression. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of chronic magnesium use on VEGF and oxidative status in the uterus. Magnesium sulfate was administered to rats at doses of 30 mg/kg (intramuscular) for 2 weeks. VEGF, Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Glutathione peroxidase (GPx), and Malondialdehyde (MDA) levels were measured using ELISA; vascular and cellular alterations were determined by histology in the uterine tissue at the metoestrus phase. In the uterine tissue of Mg-treated subjects, magnesium levels increased while VEGF, SOD, GPx, and MDA levels decreased without histological changes. There was a negative correlation between uterine tissue magnesium levels and VEGF, SOD, GPx, and MDA levels. Consequently, the results of this study demonstrated that regular magnesium use decreased VEGF levels in uterus. Decreased VEGF levels were associated with decreased uterine oxidative stress. Chronic magnesium usage may protect the uterine tissue from certain diseases in which angiogenesis is critical.

Abstract

Magnesium (Mg) and some of its alloys have attracted extensive interests for biomedical applications as they exhibit biodegradability and low elastic modulus that is closer to natural bones than the currently used metallic implant materials such as titanium (Ti) and its alloys, stainless steels, and cobalt-chromium (Co-Cr) alloys. However, the rapid degradation of Mg alloys and loss of their mechanical integrity before sufficient bone healing impede their clinical application. Our literature review shows that magnesium matrix nanocomposites (MMNCs) reinforced with nanoparticles possess enhanced strength, high corrosion resistance, and good biocompatibility. This article provides a detailed analysis of the effects of nanoparticle reinforcements on the mechanical properties, corrosion behavior, and biocompatibility of MMNCs as promising biodegradable implant materials. The governing equations to quantitatively predict the mechanical properties and underlying synergistic strengthening mechanisms in MMNCs are elucidated. The potential, recent advances, challenges and future research directions in relation to nanoparticles reinforced MMNCs are highlighted. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Critically reviewing magnesium metal matrix nanocomposites (MMNCs) for the biomedical application. Clear definitions of strengthening mechanisms using reinforcement particle in the magnesium matrix, as there were controversial in governing equations of strengthening parameters. Providing better understanding of the effect of particle size, volume fraction, interfacial bonding, and uniform dispersion of reinforcement particles on MMNCs.

Abstract

Calcium and magnesium affect muscle mass and function. Magnesium and calcium are also important for optimal vitamin D status. Vitamin D status modifies the associations between physical activity and risk of incident cardiovascular disease (CVD) and CVD mortality. However, no study examined whether levels of magnesium and calcium and the ratio of dietary calcium to magnesium (Ca:Mg) intake modify the relationship between physical activity and mortality. We included 20,295 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey participants (1999-2006) aged >20 years with complete dietary, physical activity and mortality data (2,663 deaths). We assessed physical activity based on public health guidelines and sex-specific tertiles of MET-minutes/week. We used Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for potential confounding factors and stratified by the intakes of magnesium, calcium, Ca:Mg ratio. We found higher physical activity was significantly associated with reduced risk of total mortality and cause-specific mortality, regardless of Ca:Mg ratio, magnesium or calcium intake. In contrast, both moderate and high physical activity were significantly associated with substantially reduced risks of mortality due to cancer when magnesium intake was above the RDA level. We also found higher physical activity was significantly associated with a reduced risk of mortality due to cancer only when Ca:Mg ratios were between 1.7 and 2.6, although the interaction was not significant. Overall, dietary magnesium and, potentially, the Ca:Mg ratio modify the relationship between physical activity and cause-specific mortality. Further study is important to understand the modifying effects of the balance between calcium and magnesium intake on physical activity for chronic disease prevention.

Abstract

Metabolic failure is associated with dyslipidemia and coagulation which can result in a higher risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this study was to assess the effects of choline and magnesium co-supplementation on lipid profile and coagulation parameters in patients with T2DM. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, supplements of choline bitartrate (1000 mg), magnesium oxide (500 mg), choline plus magnesium, or placebo were administered for 2 months to 96 diabetic participants of both sexes aged 30-60 years. Anthropometric characteristics, dietary intake, physical activity, serum lipids, and coagulation markers were measured in all subjects. Significant differences were observed in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) levels in the magnesium and choline-magnesium groups (p < 0.05). Moreover, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) levels increased in choline-magnesium groups (p < 0.001). When adjusted for potential confounders, a significant decrease in PAI-1 (p = 0.03) and a marginally significant increase in tPA (p = 0.054) were found in the choline-magnesium group compared with the other groups. Compared with baseline values, there were significant differences in serum magnesium, HDL, and triglycerides (TG) following choline-magnesium co-supplementation (p < 0.05); however, there were no significant differences in serum magnesium, HDL, and TG among the groups (p > 0.05). Overall, concurrent supplementation of magnesium and choline is more effective than either magnesium or choline alone to improve coagulation in subjects with T2DM.

Abstract

Objectives: In this study, changes in lactate clearance following magnesium supplementation were evaluated in critically ill patients with severe sepsis.

Methods: Fifty-eight patients with severe sepsis were randomly assigned to receive either magnesium (n = 30) or placebo (n = 28). Patients in the magnesium group received intravenous magnesium sulfate to maintain serum magnesium level around 3 mg/dL for 3 days. The placebo group received the same volume of normal saline. Change in lactate clearance was considered primary outcome of the study.

Results: Mean increase in the lactate clearance in the magnesium group was significantly higher than the placebo group on day 2 (27.53% vs. 23.79% respectively, p < 0.001) and day 3 (49.83% vs. 37.02% respectively, p < 0.001). Time to lactate clearance was also significantly shorter in the magnesium group than the placebo group (47.28 ± 20.59 vs. 61.20 ± 24.31 h respectively, p = 0.03). Sepsis-related mortality was not significantly different but median length of ICU stay was significantly shorter in the magnesium group than the placebo group (8 vs. 15 days respectively, p < 0.01).

Conclusions: Magnesium supplementation increased lactate clearance in critically ill patients with severe sepsis. Optimizing serum magnesium level near the upper limit of the normal range may improve severe sepsis outcomes.

Abstract

A number of studies have assessed the association between serum magnesium (Mg) and premenstrual syndrome (PMS) in different population, but the findings have been inconclusive. Herein, we systematically reviewed available observational studies to elucidate the overall relationship between Mg and PMS. PubMed, Cochrane's library, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Google Scholar, and ISI web of science databases were searched for all available literature until January 2019 for studies evaluating the association between Mg and PMS. The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale was used to assess the quality of observational studies. A total of 13 studies out of 196 met our inclusion criteria and were included in our systematic review and meta-analysis. There were no associations between serum magnesium and PMS (WMD - 0.04; 95% CI, - 0.14 to 0.06; P = 0.46) during follicular or serum/erythrocyte magnesium (WMD - 0.37; 95% CI, - 1.01 to 0.27; P = 0.25)/(WMD - 0.04; 95% CI, - 0.10 to 0.03; P = 0.26) and during luteal phase except for the sub-group of studies done outside of the US in which recent association became significant and means that serum Mg is lower in PMS subjects. According to what have been discussed, although our study did not show any significant association between serum/erythrocyte Mg and PMS except for serum Mg in luteal phase in the sub-group of studies done outside of the USA, heterogeneity between studies should be taken into accounts when interpreting these results. Additional well-designed clinical trials should be considered in future research to develop firm conclusions on the efficacy of magnesium on PMS.Registration number: CRD42018114473 .

Abstract

The study was designed to determine the impact of magnesium (Mg2+) on bovine embryo development. We found that two commercially available sources of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and fetal bovine serum (FBS) contained different amounts of Mg2+ residue: 4 ppm in ICPbio BSA, 114 ppm in Sigma BSA, and 44 ppm in FBS. When CR1 was used as basal medium, PVA and ICPbio BSA produced the lowest blastocyst yield (2.2-2.3%), whereas Sigma BSA increased blastocyst yield to 18.9% (P < 0.05). Supplementation of 1.4 mM MgCl2 into the medium increased the blastocyst rate in the ICPbio BSA group (29.4%) but not in the PVA group (5.4%; P < 0.05) to a level comparable to that of the FBS group (33.7%; P > 0.05). We next found that increasing concentrations of MgCl2 in the culture medium (ICPbio BSA) elevated blastocyst rate from 2.6% (0 mM), 38.4% (0.35 mM) to 50.2% (1.4 mM; P < 0.05), further maintained at 44.9% (2.1 mM) and 43.4% (2.8 mM) (P > 0.05). However, blastocyst rate was reduced to 31.4% (4.2 mM) and 29.4% (5.6 mM) when MgCl2 supplement was increased (P < 0.05). Comparable blastocyst development was achieved in both ICPbio BSA (30.0-33.1%) and Sigma BSA (37.4-38.7%) groups when 1.4 mM Mg2+ was supplemented regardless of its source (MgCl2 vs. MgSO4; P > 0.05). In embryo transfer experiments, higher rates of pregnancy (54.3 vs. 41.5%) and calving (44.3 vs. 32.5%) were achieved in the CR1-Mg2+-supplemented BSA group compared with the FBS group with co-culture, respectively (P < 0.05). These results demonstrate that Mg2+ is a key ion that promotes competent blastocyst and term development. Therefore, a simple and efficient defined medium (CR1-Mg2+-BSA) can successfully replace complex serum and somatic cell co-culture.

Abstract

None of the clinical trials on migraine conducted thus far have focused on the possibility to modulate the phenomenon of aura. Furthermore, whether proper management of aura results in a better control of the headache phase has been poorly investigated. In the setting of a single-center, pilot, clinical trial, we aimed at comparing the effects of Aurastop (a combination of tanacetum parthenium (150 mg extracted at 0.8% = 1.2 mg di of active parthenolide), griffonia simplicifoila (20 mg of 5-hydroxy tryptophan), and magnesium (185 mg of magnesium pidolatum)) with those of magnesium alone (2.25 grams/tablet, corresponding to 184 mg of Mg++) in the treatment of acute attacks of migraine with aura. Between June 2017 and June 2018, 50 consecutive patients (27/23 male/female; mean age, 31 [18-57] years) with at least 3 episodes of aura per year were included (t 0). Participants were instructed to keep track of the following 4 episodes of migraine with aura (t 1) and invited to assume (1) a tablet of Aurastop at the beginning of the following 2 episodes of aura and (2) a magnesium tablet alone at the occurrence of the third and fourth aura attacks. Forty-eight patients (96.0%) had >50% reduction in aura duration when treated with Aurastop vs. 7 patients (14.0%) when treated with magnesium alone (p < 0.001); 48 patients (96.0%) had >50% reduction of aura-related disability when receiving Aurastop vs. 5 patients (10.0%) when treated with magnesium alone (p < 0.001); however, patients receiving Aurastop did not need to take pain killers in 35% of aura attacks vs. 3% when assuming magnesium (p < 0.001). These results support the hypothesis that Aurastop might be effective in interfering with the phenomenon of aura and provide evidence that the clinical benefit attributable to this combination of molecules might be greater than that obtained with single compounds of proven effect on the biology of migraine.

Abstract

Background: Postmenopausal women represent the highest population-based burden of cardiovascular disease, including sudden cardiac death (SCD). Our understanding of the etiology and risk factors contributing to fatal coronary heart disease (CHD) and SCD, particularly among women, is limited. This study examines the association between dietary magnesium intake and fatal CHD and SCD. Materials and Methods: We examined 153,569 postmenopausal women who participated in the Women's Health Initiative recruited between 1993 and 1998. Magnesium intake at baseline was assessed using a validated food frequency questionnaire, adjusting for energy via the residual method. Fatal CHD and SCD were identified over an average follow-up of 10.5 years. Results: For every standard deviation increase in magnesium intake, there was statistically significant risk reduction, after adjustment for confounders, of 7% for fatal CHD (hazard ratio [HR] 0.93, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.89-0.97), and 18% risk reduction for SCD (HR 0.82, 95% CI 0.58-1.15) the latter of which did not reach statistical significance. In age-adjusted quartile analysis, women with the lowest magnesium intake (189 mg/day) had the greatest risk for fatal CHD (HR 1.54, 95% CI 1.40-1.69) and SCD (HR 1.70, 95% CI 0.94-3.07). This association was attenuated in the fully adjusted model, with HRs of 1.19 (95% CI 1.06-1.34) for CHD and 1.24 (95% CI 0.58-2.65) for SCD for the lowest quartile of magnesium intake. Conclusions: This study provides evidence of a potential inverse association between dietary magnesium and fatal CHD and a trend of magnesium with SCD in postmenopausal women. Future studies should confirm this association and consider clinical trials to test whether magnesium supplementation could reduce fatal CHD in high-risk individuals.

Abstract

Magnesium (Mg) alloys are embraced for their biodegradability and biocompatibility. However, Mg degrades spontaneously in the biological environment in vivo and in vitro, triggering deposition of calcium phosphate on the metal. Upon complete metal absorption, minerals remain in the tissue, which could lead to pathogenic calcification. Hence, our aims are to test the feasibility of matrix GLA protein (MGP) to locally inhibit Mg mineralization that is induced by metal alloy degradation. MGP is a small secretory protein that has been shown to inhibit soft tissue calcification. We exposed Mg to MGP, stably transfected into mammalian cells. Results showed that less calcium and phosphorous deposition on the Mg surface when MGP was present relative to when it was not. In the in vivo mouse intramuscular model conducted for 4 and 6 weeks, Mg rods were embedded in collagen scaffolds, seeded with cells overexpressing MGP. Microtomography, electron dispersive x-ray spectroscopy, and histology assessments revealed lower deposited mineral volume around Mg rods from the MGP group. Compared to other groups, higher volume loss after implantation was observed from the MGP group at both time points, indicating a higher corrosion rate without the protective mineral layer. This study is the first to our knowledge to demonstrate that local exposure to a biomolecule, such as MGP, can modulate the corrosion of Mg-based implants. These findings may have important implications for the future design of endovascular stents and orthopedic devices.

Abstract

Total serum magnesium is a common clinical measurement for assessing magnesium status; however, magnesium in blood represents less than 1% of the body's total magnesium content. We measured intramuscular ionized magnesium by phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P-MRS) and tested the hypothesis that this measure better correlates with skeletal muscle function and captures more closely the effect of aging than the traditional measure of total serum magnesium. Data were collected from 441 participants (age 24-98 years) in the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (BLSA), a study of normative aging that encompasses a broad age range. Results showed that intramuscular ionized magnesium was negatively associated with age (β = -0.29, p < 0.001, R 2 = 0.08) and positively associated with knee-extension strength (β = 0.31, p < 0.001, and R 2 = 0.1 in women; and β = 0.2, p = 0.003, and R 2 = 0.04 in men), while total serum magnesium showed no association with age or strength (p = 0.27 and 0.1, respectively). Intramuscular ionized magnesium was significantly lower in women that in men (p < 0.001), perhaps due to chronic latent Mg deficiency in women that is not otherwise detected by serum magnesium levels. Based on these findings, we suggest that intramuscular ionized magnesium from 31P-MRS is a better clinical measure of magnesium status than total serum magnesium, and could be measured when muscle weakness of unidentified etiology is detected. It may also be used to monitor the effectiveness of oral magnesium interventions, including supplementation.

Abstract

Mechanisms of magnesium homeostasis in Mycobacterium tuberculosis are poorly understood. Here, we describe the characterization of a pyrimidinetrione amide scaffold that disrupts magnesium homeostasis in the pathogen by direct binding to the CorA Mg2+/Co2+ transporter. Mutations in domains of CorA that are predicted to regulate the pore opening in response to Mg2+ ions conferred resistance to this scaffold. The pyrimidinetrione amides were cidal against the pathogen under both actively replicating and nonreplicating conditions in vitro and were efficacious against the organism during macrophage infection. However, the compound lacked efficacy in infected mice, possibly due to limited exposure. Our results indicate that inhibition of Mg2+ homeostasis by CorA is an attractive target for tuberculosis drug discovery and encourage identification of improved CorA inhibitors.

Abstract

Background: Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) is routinely treated with B-vitamins. However, the relationship between thiamine status and outcome is rarely examined. The aim of the present study was to examine the relationship between thiamine and magnesium status in patients with AWS.

Methods: Patients (n = 127) presenting to the Emergency Department with AWS were recruited to a prospective observational study. Blood samples were drawn to measure whole blood thiamine diphosphate (TDP) and serum magnesium concentrations. Routine biochemistry and haematology assays were also conducted. The Glasgow Modified Alcohol Withdrawal Score (GMAWS) measured severity of AWS. Seizure history and current medications were also recorded.

Results: The majority of patients (99%) had whole blood TDP concentration within/above the reference interval (275-675 ng/gHb) and had been prescribed thiamine (70%). In contrast, the majority of patients (60%) had low serum magnesium concentrations (< 0.75 mmol/L) and had not been prescribed magnesium (93%). The majority of patients (66%) had plasma lactate concentrations above 2.0 mmol/L. At 1 year, 13 patients with AWS had died giving a mortality rate of 11%. Male gender (p < 0.05), BMI < 20 kg/m2 (p < 0.01), GMAWS max ≥ 4 (p < 0.05), elevated plasma lactate (p < 0.01), low albumin (p < 0.05) and elevated serum CRP (p < 0.05) were associated with greater 1-year mortality. Also, low serum magnesium at time of recruitment to study and low serum magnesium at next admission were associated with higher 1-year mortality rates, (84% and 100% respectively; both p < 0.05).

Conclusion: The prevalence of low circulating thiamine concentrations were rare and it was regularly prescribed in patients with AWS. In contrast, low serum magnesium concentrations were common and not prescribed. Low serum magnesium was associated more severe AWS and increased 1-year mortality.

Abstract

The significant cytopathological changes of osteoarthritis are chondrocyte hypertrophy, proteoglycan loss, extracellular matrix (ECM) calcification, and terminally, the replacement of cartilage by bone. Meanwhile, magnesium ion (Mg2+ ), as the second most abundant divalent cation in the human body, has been proved to inhibit the ECM calcification of hBMSCs (human bone marrow stromal cells), hVSMCs (Human vascular smooth muscle cells), and TDSCs (tendon-derived stem cells) in vitro studies. The ATDC5 cell line, which holds chondrocyte characteristics, was used in this study as an in vitro subject. We found that Mg2+ can efficiently suppress the ECM calcification and downregulate both hypertrophy and matrix metalloproteinase-related genes. Meanwhile, Mg2+ inhibits the formation of autophagy by inhibiting Erk phosphorylation signaling and lowers the expression of LC3, and eventually effectively reduces the formation of ECM calcification in vitro. In this study, we also used destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM)-induced osteoarthritis (OA) animal model to further confirm the protective effect of Mg2+ on articular cartilage. Compared with the control group (saline-injected), continuous intra-articular magnesium chloride (MgCl2 ) injection can significantly alleviate the severity of cartilage calcification in OA animal model. Immunofluorescence staining also revealed that saline-injected DMM group had a higher positive rate of LC3 expression in cartilage chondrocytes, compared with MgCl2 -injected DMM group. In general, Mg2+ can significantly downregulate the hypertrophic gene Runx2, MMP13, and Col10α1, upregulate the chondrogenic genes Sox9 and Col1α1, inhibit the Erk phosphorylation signaling, reduce the expression of autophagy protein LC3, and effectively inhibit the ECM calcification of ATDC5. In vivo study also proved that intra-articular injection of Mg2+ protected knee cartilage by inhibiting the autophagy formation.

Abstract

Background: A positive correlation between calcium and magnesium serum levels is well known and depends upon various factors. This study aims at verifying the existence of this association in a retrospective series of patients who underwent thyroid surgery.

Methods: Two hundred and eighty-five consecutive patients (202 female, 83 male, mean age 57 years) who underwent at least total thyroidectomy (TT) and had a complete clinical and biochemical pre- and postoperative evaluation were included in the study. Patients were evaluated with regard to: sex, age, indications for surgery, operative time, number of accidentally removed parathyroids, extent and time of surgery, thyroiditis, final histology, pre- and postoperative levels of calcium, magnesium, vitamin D, and creatinine, presence of symptoms of hypocalcemia. Statistical analysis was performed using the R software.

Results: In the postoperative period, biochemical hypocalcemia (<8.5 mg/dL) was observed in 126 patients (44%) and severe hypocalcemia (<7.5 mg/dL, a level indicating the need for longer hospitalization) was seen in 40 (14%). When analyzing patients with and without postoperative hypocalcemia, the factors affecting postoperative biochemical hypocalcemia were: older age (P=0.019), longer operative time (P=0.039), and a highly significant correlation between postoperative calcium and magnesium levels (r=0.432; P<0.001).

Conclusions: The only factor among the ones we analyzed in this retrospective study that would appear to be linked to the onset of clinically relevant hypocalcemia is low magnesium levels in the postoperative period. A prospective randomized study with a group of patients undergoing magnesium replacement in the postoperative period can clarify the possible role of magnesium repletion on hypocalcemia.

Abstract

Objective: Determine food intake and levels of serum magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) and correlate these minerals with pain, quality of life and depression risk in women with and without fibromyalgia (FM).

Patients and methods: Fifty-three women diagnosed with FM and 50 healthy women participated in the study, where all of them had equivalent age and body mass index (BMI). All women underwent anthropometric assessment, physical exams of pain perception threshold and tender point (TP) count, blood sample collection, and filling out of FM impact questionnaire (FIQ), Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and 3-day dietary record (DR).

Results: Dietary intake of Mg and Ca was substantially lower by women with FM. There were no differences in levels of serum Mg and Ca in the groups under analysis. For the FM group, dietary intake of Mg and Ca had inverse correlation with TP and direct relation with the pain threshold.

Conclusions: Although women with FM had lower dietary intake of Mg and Ca, serum levels for these nutrients were not different between the groups. Low dietary intake of minerals correlated with worsened pain threshold parameters.

Abstract

Evidence from observational studies suggests that increased exposure to calcium may increase the risk of coronary heart disease and stroke whereas magnesium might have a protective effect on disease risk. However, studies of the associations of these minerals with heart failure are scarce and limited by potential biases introduced by confounding and reverse causality. We applied a two-sample Mendelian randomization design using summary estimates to assess whether serum calcium and magnesium concentrations are causally associated with heart failure. Summary statistics data were collected for seven and six single-nucleotide polymorphisms associated with calcium and magnesium, respectively, from the hitherto largest genome-wide association studies on these minerals. Corresponding summary statistics for genetic associations with heart failure were available from publicly available data based on the UK Biobank study and based on participants of European ancestry. The findings showed that neither serum calcium nor magnesium concentrations were associated with heart failure. In the standard inverse-variance weighted analysis, the odds ratios of heart failure per genetically predicted one standard deviation increase in mineral concentrations were 0.89 (95% confidence interval 0.67-1.17; p = 0.41) for serum calcium and 0.89 (95% confidence interval 0.72-1.10; p = 0.28) for serum magnesium. Results were robust in sensitivity analyses, including the weighted median and Mendelian randomization Egger analyses. In conclusion, these findings do not support previous findings suggesting a link between serum calcium and magnesium and heart failure, but this study was underpowered to detect weak associations.

Abstract

Vascular calcification is a life-threatening complication in patients with chronic kidney disease. Magnesium is a potent inhibitor of calcification and attracting attention as a new therapeutic candidate. ter Braake and colleagues demonstrate that magnesium supplementation strikingly prevents vascular calcification in Klotho knockout mice. However, these mice also show osteomalacia, indicating that magnesium has a Janus face. Maximizing the beneficial effects of magnesium without causing bone mineralization defects is an important next challenge.

Abstract

Background: "Rules of thumb" for the replacement of electrolytes, including magnesium, in critical care settings are used, despite minimal empirical validation of their ability to achieve a target serum concentration. This study's purpose was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety surrounding magnesium replacement in medically, critically ill patients with mild-to-moderate hypomagnesemia.

Methods: This was a single-center, retrospective, observational evaluation of episodes of intravenous magnesium replacement ordered for patients with mild-to-moderate hypomagnesemia (1.0-1.9 mEq/L) admitted to a medical intensive care unit from May 2014 to April 2016. The primary effectiveness outcome, achievement of target serum magnesium concentration (≥2 mEq/L) compared to expected achievement using a "rule of thumb" estimation that 1 g intravenous magnesium sulfate raises the magnesium concentration 0.15 mEq/L, was tested using 1-sample z test. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess the effect of infusion rate on target achievement.

Results: Of 152 days on which magnesium replacements were provided for 72 patients, a follow-up serum magnesium concentration was checked within 24 hours in 89 (58.6%) episodes. Of these 89 episodes, serum magnesium concentration reached target in only 49 (59.8%) episodes compared to an expected 89 (100%; P < .0001). There was no significant association between infusion rate and achievement of the target serum magnesium concentration (odds ratio: 0.962, 95% confidence interval: 0.411-2.256).

Conclusions: Medically, critically ill patients who received nonprotocolized magnesium replacement achieved the target serum magnesium concentration less frequently than the "rule of thumb" estimation predicted.

Abstract

Background: Previous studies reported that magnesium deficiency was associated with vascular calcifications, atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease, which might play an independent pathogenic role in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. However, the results of these studies were somewhat underpowered and inconclusive.

Methods: Literature was identified by searching PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). We included studies that investigated the association between serum magnesium with mortality risk in CKD and ESRD patients. Unadjusted and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were pooled.

Results: Twenty studies involving 200,934 participants were included, and the results showed that there was a strong association between hypomagnesemia and the risk of all-cause mortality in patients with CKD and ESRD (HR 1.32; 95% CI 1.19-1.47; p < 0.00001) (hypomagnesemia vs. normal magnesium or hypermagnesemia) after multivariable adjusted. On the contrary, hypermagnesemia was inversely associated with all-cause mortality in patients with CKD and ESRD (HR 0.86; 95% CI 0.79-0.94; p = 0.001) (per unit increase). Moreover, a significant association between hypermagnesemia and decreased risk of cardiovascular mortality was observed (HR 0.71; 95% CI 053-0.97, p = 0.03) in the adjusted model. In addition, subgroup analysis found that hypomagnesemia was strongly associated with increased all-cause mortality in hemodialysis patients (HR 1.29; 95% CI 1.12-1.50; p = 0.0005) (hypomagnesemia vs. normal magnesium or hypermagnesemia).

Conclusions: Our results indicate that hypomagnesemia is significantly associated with cardiovascular and all-cause mortality in patients with CKD and ESRD. Further studies evaluating benefits of magnesium correction in CKD and dialysis patients with hypomagnesemia should be performed.

Abstract

This cross-sectional analytical study was carried out to observe serum magnesium in type 2 diabetes mellitus patients and was performed in the department of Physiology, Mymensingh Medical College, Mymensingh, Bangladesh from January 2016 to December 2016. For this purpose, a total number of 200 subjects of both sexes with age ranged from 30-60 years were selected of whom 100 were type 2 diabetic person and 100 were apparently healthy. Serum magnesium was significantly lower (p<0.0001) in both male and female of the study group in comparison to healthy control group. From this study, it may conclude that type 2 persons are considered to have significant positive relation for formation of hypomagnesaemia. So, prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus by taking necessary steps like regular physical exercise, intake of healthy diet and behavior therapy may supplementation of magnesium help in prevention of type 2 diabetes mellitus related complication.

Abstract

Background: We aimed to evaluate the associations between calcium and various stages of colorectal carcinogenesis and whether these associations are modified by the calcium to magnesium (Ca:Mg) ratio.

Methods: We tested our hypotheses in the prostate lung, colorectal and ovarian cancer screening trial.

Results: Calcium intake did not show a dose-response association with incident adenoma of any size/stage (P-trend = 0.17), but followed an inverse trend when restricted to synchronous/advanced adenoma cases (P-trend = 0.05). This inverse trend was mainly in participants with Ca:Mg ratios between 1.7 and 2.5 (P-trend = 0.05). No significant associations were observed for metachronous adenoma. Calcium intake was inversely associated with CRC (P-trend = 0.03); the association was primarily present for distal CRC (P-trend = 0.01). The inverse association between calcium and distal CRC was further modified by the Ca:Mg ratio (P-interaction < 0.01); significant dose-response associations were found only in participants with a Ca:Mg ratio between 1.7 and 2.5 (P-trend = 0.04). No associations for calcium were found in the Ca:Mg ratio above 2.5 or below 1.7.

Conclusion: Higher calcium intake may be related to reduced risks of incident advanced and/or synchronous adenoma and incident distal CRC among subjects with Ca:Mg intake ratios between 1.7 and 2.5.

Abstract

Introduction: The effects of magnesium (Mg) supplementation on vascular function have been evaluated in some randomized controlled trials (RCT) but their results are conflicting.

Aim: A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to summarize the effects of oral Mg supplementation on vascular function in RCT.

Methods: The databases MEDLINE (PubMed), Embase, Web of Science and Cochrane Library were accessed from inception to May 27, 2019. Intergroup differences (treatment vs. control group) related to changes in flow-mediated dilation (FMD) and pulse wave velocity (PWV), expressed as mean and standard deviation, were used to evaluate the effect of Mg supplementation on these outcomes. The results of the meta-analysis were expressed using a random-effects model. The heterogeneity between studies was evaluated using the I2 statistic.

Results: The oral supplementation of Mg had no significant effect on FMD (mean difference 2.13; 95% CI - 0.56, 4.82; p = 0.12) and PWV (mean difference - 0.54, 95% CI - 1.45, 0.36, p = 0.24). Heterogeneity for both outcomes (FMD and PWV) was high (I2 = 99%, p < 0.001). However, in subgroup analyses, oral Mg significantly improved FMD in studies longer than 6 months, in unhealthy subjects, in individuals older than 50 years, or in those with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m2. The reduced number of RCT and the heterogeneity among them were the main limitations.

Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggest that oral Mg supplementation may improve endothelial function when conducted at least for 6 months and in unhealthy, overweight or older individuals. Registration number: PROSPERO CRD42019111462.

Abstract

Background: Magnesium (Mg2+)-enriched microenvironment promotes odontogenic differentiation in human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs), but the regulatory mechanisms remain undefined. The aim of this work was to assess magnesium's function in the above process and to explore the associated signaling pathway.

Methods: DPSCs underwent culture in odontogenic medium with the addition of 0, 1, 5, or 10 mM MgCl2. Intracellular Mg2+ levels in DPSCs were evaluated flow cytometrically using Mag-Fluo-4-AM. Mg2+-entry was inhibited by TRPM7 inhibitor 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB). RNA-Sequencing was carried out for assessing transcriptome alterations in DPSCs during odontogenic differentiation associated with high extracellular Mg2+. KEGG pathway analysis was performed to determine pathways related to the retrieved differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Immunoblot was performed for assessing magnesium's role and exploring ERK/BMP2/Smads signaling.

Results: Mg2+-enriched microenvironment promoted odontogenic differentiation in DPSCs via intracellular Mg2+ increase. Consistently, the positive effect of high extracellular Mg2+ on odontogenic differentiation in DPSCs was blocked by 2-APB, which reduced Mg2+ entry. RNA-sequencing identified 734 DEGs related to odontogenic differentiation in DPSCs in the presence of high extracellular Mg2+. These DEGs participated in many cascades such as MAPK and TGF-β pathways. Consistently, ERK and BMP2/Smads pathways were activated in DPSCs treated with high extracellular Mg2+. In agreement, ERK signaling inhibition by U0126 blunted the effect of high extracellular Mg2+ on mineralization and odontogenic differentiation in DPSCs. Interestingly, BMP2, BMPR1, and phosphorylated Smad1/5/9 were significantly decreased by U0126, indicating that BMP2/Smads acted as downstream of ERK.

Conclusions: Mg2+-enriched microenvironment promotes odontogenic differentiation in DPSCs by activating ERK/BMP2/Smads signaling via intracellular Mg2+ increase. This study revealed that Mg2+-enriched microenvironment could be used as a new strategy for dental pulp regeneration.

Abstract

Objectives: Magnesium has been 'the forgotten ion' for many years. Over the past decade, however, the role of magnesium in essential physiological functions and several illness conditions have been elucidated. Nevertheless, the investigation of magnesium in cats with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and nephrolithiasis is yet to be determined. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether CKD cats with nephrolithiasis have changes in total serum magnesium concentrations, and whether magnesium disorders may be associated with other electrolyte disturbances, as well as with prognosis. We also aimed to evaluate whether total serum magnesium concentration differs between CKD cats with and without nephrolithiasis.

Methods: Total serum magnesium concentrations were assessed in 42 cats with CKD with stage 1-4 nephrolithiasis. The correlation between magnesium and other electrolytes, as well as Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, were performed. We also selected 14 control cats with CKD without nephrolithiasis age-matched with 14 cats with CKD with nephrolithiasis.

Results: Hypermagnesemia was observed in 16/42 (38.1%) and hypomagnesemia in 6/42 (14.3%) cats. Serum magnesium abnormalities were observed in cats of all stages, and marked hypermagnesemia was noted in cats with stage 4 CKD with nephrolithiasis (P <0.001). There was a negative correlation between total serum magnesium and ionized calcium (r = -0.64; P <0.01), and a positive correlation between total serum magnesium and serum phosphorus (r = 0.58, P = 0.01). Cats with CKD with nephrolithiasis and hypomagnesemia or hypermagnesemia had higher mortality than those with normal total serum magnesium concentration (P <0.01), regardless of CKD stage. There was no difference in total serum magnesium concentration between CKD cats with and without nephrolithiasis.

Conclusions and relevance: Cats with CKD with nephrolithiasis have magnesium abnormalities. Hypomagnesemia and hypermagnesemia were associated with an increase in mortality, and thus total serum magnesium abnormalities may be used as prognostic factors in these cases.

Abstract

Magnesium alloys are a promising new class of degradable biomaterials that have a similar stiffness to bone, which minimizes the harmful effects of stress shielding. Use of biodegradable magnesium implants eliminates the need for a second surgery for repair or removal. There is a growing interest to capitalize on additive manufacturing's unique design capabilities to advance the frontiers of medicine. However, magnesium alloys are difficult to 3D print due to the high chemical reactivity that poses a combustion risk. Furthermore, the low vaporization temperature of magnesium and common biocompatible alloying elements further increases the difficulty to print fully dense structures that balance strength and corrosion requirements. The purpose of this study is to survey current techniques to 3D print magnesium constructs and provide guidance on best additive practices for these alloys.

Abstract

Background: The use of poly-l-lactide acid-based bioresorbable scaffolds is limited in daily clinical practice because of safety concerns and lack of physiological benefit. Magnesium-based bioresorbable scaffold (MgBRS) presents a short resorption period (<1 year) and have the potential of being thromboresistant and exhibiting early restoration of vasomotor function. To date, however, no randomized clinical trial has investigated the performance of MgBRS. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the in-stent/scaffold vasomotion between MgBRS and permanent metallic sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) at 12-month follow-up in ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction patients.

Methods: This investigator-driven, multicenter, randomized, single-blind, controlled trial randomized ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction patients 1:1 to SES or MgBRS at 11 academic centers. The primary end point was the rate of increase (≥3%) after nitroglycerin in mean lumen diameter of the in-stent/scaffold segment at 12 months with superiority of MgBRS over SES in the as-treated population. The main secondary end points included angiographic parameters of restenosis, device-oriented composite end point, their individual components, and device thrombosis rate. Besides, endothelial-dependent vasomotor response to acetylcholine (ie, endothelial function) was also assessed in a subgroup of patients (n=69).

Results: Between June 2017 and June 2018, 150 ST-segment-elevation myocardial infarction patients were randomized (MgBRS, n=74; SES, n=76). At 1 year, the primary end point was significantly higher in the MgBRS arm (56.5% versus 33.8%; P=0.010). Conversely, late lumen loss was significantly lower in the SES group (in-segment: 0.39±0.49mm versus 0.02±0.27mm, P<0.001; in-device: 0.61±0.55mm versus 0.06±0.21mm; P<0.001). The device-oriented composite end point was higher in the MgBRS arm driven by an increase in ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization rate (12[16.2%] versus 4[5.2%], P=0.030). Definite thrombosis rate was similar between groups (1[1.4%] in the MgBRS arm versus 2[2.6%] in the SES group; P=1.0). Endothelial function assessment at device segment evidenced a more pronounced vasoconstrictive response to maximal dose of acetylcholine in the MgBRS arm (-8.3±3.5% versus -2.4±1.3% in the SES group, P=0.003).

Conclusions: When compared to SES, MgBRS demonstrated a higher capacity of vasomotor response to pharmacological agents (either endothelium-independent or endothelium-dependent) at 1 year. However, MgBRS was associated with a lower angiographic efficacy, a higher rate of target lesion revascularization, without thrombotic safety concerns.

Abstract

Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are used by millions of patients for the treatment of stomach acid-reflux diseases. Although PPIs are generally considered safe, about 13% of the users develop hypomagnesemia. Despite rising attention for this issue, the underlying mechanism is still unknown. Here, we examine whether the gut microbiome is involved in the development of PPI-induced hypomagnesemia in wild-type C57BL/6J mice. After 4 wk of treatment under normal or low dietary Mg2+ availability, omeprazole significantly reduced serum Mg2+ levels only in mice on a low-Mg2+ diet without affecting the mRNA expression of colonic or renal Mg2+ transporters. Overall, 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed a lower gut microbial diversity in omeprazole-treated mice. Omeprazole induced a shift in microbial composition, which was associated with a 3- and 2-fold increase in the abundance of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, respectively. To examine the metabolic consequences of these microbial alterations, the colonic composition of organic acids was evaluated. Low dietary Mg2+ intake, independent of omeprazole treatment, resulted in a 10-fold increase in formate levels. Together, these results imply that both omeprazole treatment and low dietary Mg2+ intake disturb the gut internal milieu and may pose a risk for the malabsorption of Mg2+ in the colon.-Gommers, L. M.

Abstract

Introduction: A relationship between serum magnesium (Mg) and body composition parameters has not been reported in hemodialysis (HD) patients. We aimed to clarify whether serum Mg has any association with body composition parameters, or survival in HD patients.

Methods: This study included 215 consecutive maintenance HD patients. Laboratory data collection and postdialysis body composition analysis were performed at baseline. The patients were divided based on baseline serum Mg level tertiles (low, medium, and high Mg groups). Kaplan-Meier survival, logistic regression analyses and Cox proportional hazard analyses were conducted.

Findings: Among all patients, the median age and dialysis vintage were 73 (65-81) years and 44 (8-96) months, respectively. The serum Mg levels were < 2.3, 2.3-2.5, and > 2.5 mg/dL for the low (n = 67), middle (n = 76), and high (n = 72) Mg groups, respectively. Compared to other groups, low Mg group showed significantly higher age and C-reactive protein levels, but lower serum albumin, normalized protein catabolic rates and frequency of on-line hemodiafiltration. The low, middle, and high Mg groups differed significantly regarding body cell mass (fat-free mass without bone mineral mass and extracellular water) index (BCMI): [5.6 (4.2-6.8), 6.0 (4.8-8.1), 6.7 (4.9-7.5) kg/m2 , respectively] and overhydration/extracellular water ratio (OH/ECW) [11.7 (4.5-21.9), 4.8 (1.0-14.1), 8.5 (-0.5-15.0) %, respectively] but not regarding body mass index, lean tissue index, fat tissue index. Hypomagnesemia was significantly associated with BCMI [odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval (CI)]: 0.85 [0.73-1.00] and OH/ECW (OR [95% CI]: 1.03 [1.01-1.05]), respectively. Kaplan-Meyer 3-year survival rates were 53.6%, 69.7%, and 71.7% in low, middle, and high Mg groups, respectively. However, hypomagnesemia was not significantly associated with 3-year all-cause mortality independent of age, serum albumin and C-reactive protein.

Discussion: Hypomagnesemia was associated with lower BCMI, more pronounced OH/ECW and poorer Kaplan-Meier 3-year cumulative survival, but was not an independent risk factor for mortality in HD patients.

Abstract

Functional constipation (FC) is a chronic constipation for which no physiological, anatomical or iatrogenic origin can be evidenced. This condition has a high impact on a patient's quality of life and healthcare costs. Since FC is frequently associated with low physical activity and a diet low in fiber and/or water, first-line recommendations focus on sufficient activity, and sufficient fiber and water intake. In case of inefficacy of these measures, numerous drug treatments are available, either over the counter or on prescription. Magnesium sulfate has a long history in the treatment of FC, and magnesium sulfate-rich mineral waters have been used for centuries for their laxative properties. The laxative effect of magnesium and sulfate has since been widely demonstrated. Nevertheless, it appears that no clinical studies aiming at demonstrating their efficacy in FC had been conducted before the 21st century. In this paper, we reviewed the clinical data reporting the efficacy of magnesium sulfate-rich natural mineral waters. In view of their reported efficacy and safety, magnesium sulfate-rich natural mineral waters may represent a natural treatment for FC.

Abstract

Background: Ketamine and magnesium sulphate showed synergic interaction in the tail-immersion test and additive interaction in the rat formalin test. Aim of study was to evaluate the influence of serotonergic and opioidergic system of this combination in the formalin test in rats.

Methods: Antinociceptive activity was assessed by the formalin test in male Wistar rats (200-250 g). Antagonists (naloxone and methysergide) were administrated 5 min before and magnesium sulphate 5 min after ketamine injection. Formalin (2.5%, 100 μL) was injected into the right hind paw surface (intraplantar) of rats 5 min after ketamine/magnesium combination. Data were recorded as the total time spent in pain related behavior after the injection of formalin or vehicle (0.9% NaCl).

Results: In the intermediate phase of the formalin test, methysergide at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg did not have any effect, but at doses of 0.5 and 1 mg/kg it had a pronociceptive effect. Methysergide (0.2, 0.5 and 1 mg/kg) inhibited the antinociceptive effect of ketamine-magnesium sulphate combination. In the intermediate phase, naloxone at a dose of 0.2 mg/kg did not have any effect, but at a dose of 3 mg/kg it produced a pronociceptive effect. Naloxone (0.2 and 3 mg/kg) antagonized the antinociceptive effect of the ketamine (5 mg/kg)-magnesium sulphate (5 mg/kg) combination.

Conclusion: The results of the present study suggest that serotonergic and opioidergic systems are involved, at least in part, in the antinociceptive effect of the ketamine-magnesium sulphate combination in the model of inflammatory pain in rats.

Abstract

This study evaluates serum copper and magnesium and total antioxidant capacity levels in PCOS patients. In this regard, the probable association of copper and magnesium with total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was investigated. In total, 150 women (60 PCOS patients and 90 healthy subjects) participated in this case-control study. PCOS was diagnosed according to the Rotterdam criteria (2003). Serum Cu, Mg, Ca, TAC, insulin levels, and insulin resistance indices were determined. Insulin was measured using ELISA methods. Serum Cu and Mg levels were measured by an atomic absorption spectrophotometer and the Xylidyl Blue method respectively. The correlations between the parameters were analyzed using the Spearman correlation test. Serum Cu level was significantly higher while TAC was significantly lower in the PCOS patients than those in the controls (p = 0.019 and p = 0.002 respectively). No significant difference was detected between the two groups in terms of serum Mg and Ca levels and Ca/Mg ratio. In insulin-resistant PCOS subjects, there was a negative correlation between Mg levels and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (r = - 0.449, p = 0.006) but a positive correlation between Mg levels and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index (r = 0.480, p = 0.003). A negative correlation also existed between Mg levels and TAC in non-insulin-resistant PCOS patients (r = - 0.407, p = 0.04). According to the results, copper and magnesium seem to contribute to oxidative stress and insulin resistance in PCOS patients. Therefore, to prevent long-term metabolic complications in PCOS women, it is recommended that these elements be routinely monitored. Also, significantly lower levels of serum TAC in PCOS patients than in normal women may suggest increased oxidative stress in such patients.

Abstract

Background and aims: Magnesium plays a key role in glucose metabolism, vascular tone, and inflammation. Therefore, it might be a dietary risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. In vitro and animal studies have suggested a decrease in vascular calcification with an increase in the magnesium intake. The objective of the present study was to investigate the association between magnesium intake and coronary artery calcium (CAC) score among participants of the ELSA-Brasil. Methods: This is an observational, cross-sectional study undertaken with a sub-sample from the ELSA-Brasil baseline data. In this sub-sample, only participants with CAC examination data were included (n = 4,306). Dietary intake was assessed by a validated food frequency questionnaire. The association between magnesium intake and presence of CAC (0 versus > 0) was investigated using multiple logistic regression models. Results: The participants were predominantly female (54.4 %), with self-reported white skin color (59.1 %), no smoking habit (53.7 %) and undergraduate or postgraduate education (44.4 %). The range of magnesium consumption was 37.24 - 1266.31 mg/day. CAC prevalence was 28.4 %. No significant association was found between magnesium intake and CAC after adjustments for diet, lifestyle, and clinical characteristics. In a first univariate model, the fifth quintile of magnesium intake, in comparison to the first quintile (lowest intake), resulted in an OR = 1.25, 95 % CI: 1.01 - 1.54 (P-linear trend = 0.005). However, in the last fully adjusted model, the fifth quintile of magnesium intake resulted in OR = 0.86, 95 % CI: 0.64 - 1.17 (P-linear trend = 0.239). Conclusions: In ELSA-Brasil, the intake of magnesium was not associated with the presence of coronary artery calcification.

Abstract

Iron and magnesium are essential nutrients for most microorganisms. In the environment, the availability of iron is low relative to that of magnesium. Microorganisms have developed various iron acquisition systems, which have been well studied, whereas few studies have examined magnesium acquisition. The production of siderophores is one of the efficient strategies widely used to sustain iron nutritional requirements. Many studies have shown that minerals, such as clays, iron oxides, and silicates, can serve as nutrient sources for bacteria. Asbestos, a natural fibrous silicate present in soil contains iron and/or magnesium, depending on the species of asbestos. Our aim was to study the acquisition of iron and magnesium from flocking asbestos waste by Pseudomonas aeruginosa and the involvement of the siderophores, pyoverdine and pyochelin. Flocking asbestos waste promoted growth under iron- and magnesium-limited conditions, together with a decrease in pyoverdine production, correlating with the dissolution of iron from the waste. In long-term experiments, flocking asbestos waste provided these two essential elements for bacterial growth and resulted in a decrease of iron in asbestos fibers. Among the enzymes required for pyochelin and pyoverdine synthesis, PchA and PvdJ were tagged with the fluorescent protein mCherry to analyze the expression patterns of proteins involved in siderophore production. Both enzymes were produced in the presence of flocking asbestos waste, suggesting a role of the pyoverdine and pyochelin pathway in asbestos dissolution. We investigated the involvement of each siderophore in iron and magnesium removal using mutants in one or both siderophore pathways. We observed a significant increase in iron extraction in the presence of siderophores and the absence of one of the two siderophores could be compensated by the other. Flocking asbestos waste represents an iron and magnesium source for P. aeruginosa, with iron removal linked to a siderophore-driven mechanism.

Abstract

Magnesium deficiency may occur for several reasons, such as inadequate intake or increased gastrointestinal or renal loss. A large body of literature suggests a relationship between magnesium deficiency and mild and moderate tension-type headaches and migraines. A number of double-blind randomized placebo-controlled trials have shown that magnesium is efficacious in relieving headaches and have led to the recommendation of oral magnesium for headache relief in several national and international guidelines. Among several magnesium salts available to treat magnesium deficiency, magnesium pidolate may have high bioavailability and good penetration at the intracellular level. Here, we discuss the cellular and molecular effects of magnesium deficiency in the brain and the clinical evidence supporting the use of magnesium for the treatment of headaches and migraines.

Abstract

OLE RNAs represent an unusual class of bacterial noncoding RNAs common in Gram-positive anaerobes. The OLE RNA of the alkaliphile Bacillus halodurans is highly expressed and naturally interacts with at least two RNA-binding proteins called OapA and OapB. The phenotypes of the corresponding knockouts include growth inhibition when exposed to ethanol or other short-chain alcohols or when incubated at modestly reduced temperatures (e.g. 20°C). Intriguingly, the OapA 'PM1' mutant, which carries two amino acid changes to a highly conserved region, yields a dominant-negative phenotype that causes more severe growth defects under these same stress conditions. Herein, we report that the PM1 strain also exhibits extreme sensitivity to elevated Mg2+ concentrations, beginning as low as 2 mM. Suppressor mutants predominantly map to genes for aconitate hydratase and isocitrate dehydrogenase, which are expected to alter cellular citrate concentrations. Citrate reduces the severity of the Mg2+ toxicity phenotype, but neither the genomic mutations nor the addition of citrate to the medium overcomes ethanol toxicity or temperature sensitivity. These findings reveal that OLE RNA and its protein partners are involved in biochemical responses under several stress conditions, wherein the unusual sensitivity to Mg2+ can be independently suppressed by specific genomic mutations.

Abstract

Magnesium (Mg)-based implants have become of interest to both academia and the medical industry. The attraction largely is due to Mg's biodegradability and ability to enhance bone healing and formation. However, the underlying mechanism of how Mg regulates osteogenesis is still unclear. Based on our previous in vivo and molecular signaling work demonstrating the osteogenic effect of Mg, the current study aims to extend this work at the molecular level especially that we also observed and quantified mineral deposits in the bone marrow space in a rabbit ulna fracture model with Mg plates and screws. Histological analysis and quantitative results of micro-CT showed mineralized deposition and a significant increase in bone volume at 8 weeks and 16 weeks post-operative. These in vivo results led us to focus on studying the effect of Mg2+ on human bone marrow stromal cells (hBMSCs). The data presented in this manuscript demonstrate the activation of the canonical Wnt signaling pathway in hBMSCs when treated with 10 mM Mg2+. With additional Mg2+ present, the protein expression of active β-catenin was significantly increased to a level similar to that of the positive control. Immunocytochemistry and the increased expression of LEF1 and Dkk1, downstream target genes that are controlled directly by active β-catenin, demonstrated the protein translocation and the activation of transcription. Taken together, these data suggest that Mg2+ induces an osteogenic effect in the bone marrow space by activating the canonical Wnt signaling pathway, which in turn causes BMSCs to differentiate toward the osteoblast lineage. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: Magnesium (Mg)-based alloys are being studied to be used in the field of implantable medical devices due to its natural biodegradability and the potential ability to promote bone regeneration. Despite many in vivo studies that demonstrated an increased new bone growth by implanting Mg-based devices, the underlying mechanism of this effect is still unclear. In order to safely use Mg-based implants on human and better control the osteogenic effect, it is necessary to understand the corresponding cellular response in the targeted area. The present study provides the rationale to study Mg ions on bone marrow stromal cells and shows the activation of canonical Wnt signaling pathway that promotes osteogenesis by in vivo and in vitro approaches.

Abstract

Objectives: There is currently no evidence that whether magnesium supplementation would improve stress-induced hyperglycemia (SIH) in critically ill patients. In this study, effects of magnesium loading dose on insulin resistance (IR) indices were evaluated in critically ill patients without diabetes having SIH.

Methods: Seventy critically ill patients with SIH were assigned to receive a loading dose of magnesium (7.5 g of magnesium sulfate in 500 mL normal saline as intravenous infusion over an 8-hour period) or placebo. Changes in baseline of serum and intracellular magnesium and serum adiponectin (AD) levels, homeostasis model assessment of IR (HOMA-IR), and HOMA-AD ratio were assessed in this study.

Results: Serum and intracellular magnesium levels increased significantly in patients in the magnesium group (P < .001). At day 3, there were significant differences between the magnesium group and the placebo group in the mean changes from baseline in the HOMA (between-group difference: -0.11; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -0.19 to -0.01; P = .02), the AD (between-group difference: 0.94; 95% CI: 0.41-1.48; P = .04), and the HOMA-AD ratio (between-group difference: -0.03; 95% CI: -0.04 to -0.01; P < .001).

Conclusion: In the present study, a single-loading dose of intravenous magnesium improved IR indices in critically ill patients with SIH.

Abstract

We hypothesized that magnesium supplementation might help improve metabolic profiles and clinical symptoms of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) through its role in insulin action. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of magnesium supplementation on metabolic profiles and levels of sex hormones in women with PCOS. In this parallel randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 60 women with PCOS aged 20-45 years were recruited. After stratification for body mass index (BMI), age, and types of medications, participants were randomly assigned to consume magnesium supplements (containing 250 mg magnesium oxide) or placebo for 8 weeks. To assess biochemical indicators, a venous blood sample was taken after an overnight fasting. The mean age of study participants was 26.4 years. We found that magnesium supplementation for 8 weeks among women with PCOS had favorable effects on BMI compared with the placebo group (changes from baseline in intervention group: - 0.31 ± 0.07 vs. 0.07 ± 0.09 kg/m2 in control group). In addition, the supplementation lead to preventing the increase in waist circumference in intervention group compared with the control group (0.02 vs. 1.15 cm). No significant effects on glycemic variables and lipid profile were seen following the magnesium supplementation. A significant increase in serum LH levels in intervention group and a decrease in placebo group were observed (P = 0.01). Although we found a significant decrease in serum testosterone levels in intervention and placebo groups, comparing the changes between the two groups, a marginally significant difference in serum testosterone levels was found (51.65 vs. 47.80 in intervention, 43.41 vs. 39.46 in placebo, P = 0.08). A significant increase in serum dehydroepiandrogens (DHEA) (136.32 vs. 172.37 intervention, 102.74 vs. 120.15 placebo, P = 0.01) was seen in two groups. Magnesium supplementation had no significant effects on FSH, 17OH-progesteron, sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), and free androgen index (FAI) levels. We found evidence indicating that magnesium supplementation did not influence serum lipid profiles and glycemic indicators among women with PCOS. Magnesium supplementation resulted in reduced BMI and testosterone levels as well as increased DHEA concentrations in women with PCOS. Also, magnesium supplementation may increase serum LH levels.

Abstract

Background: Higher concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 [25(OH)D3] at diagnosis are associated with a lower mortality risk in colorectal cancer (CRC) patients. However, magnesium and calcium are important in vitamin D metabolism.

Objectives: We aimed to investigate 25(OH)D3, magnesium, or calcium and their interaction among patients with CRC in relation to recurrence and all-cause mortality.

Methods: The study population included 1169 newly diagnosed stage I-III CRC patients from 2 prospective cohorts. Associations between 25(OH)D3 concentrations, magnesium or calcium intake through diet and/or supplements at diagnosis, and recurrence and all-cause mortality were evaluated using multivariable Cox proportional hazard models. The interaction between 25(OH)D3 and magnesium or calcium was assessed by investigating 1) joint compared with separate effects, using a single reference category; and 2) the effect estimates of 1 factor across strata of another.

Results: Serum 25(OH)D3, calcium, and magnesium, alone and their interactions, were not associated with recurrence. Serum 25(OH)D3 concentrations seemed to be associated with all-cause mortality. An inverse association between magnesium intake (HRQ3 vs. Q1: 0.55; 95% CI: 0.32, 0.95 and HRQ4 vs. Q1: 0.65; 95% CI: 0.35, 1.21), but not calcium intake, and all-cause mortality was observed. When investigating the interaction between 25(OH)D3 and magnesium, we observed the lowest risk of all-cause mortality in patients with sufficient vitamin D concentrations (≥50 nmol/L) and a high magnesium intake (median split) (HR: 0.53; 95% CI: 0.31, 0.89) compared with patients who were vitamin D deficient (<50 nmol/L) and had a low magnesium intake. No interactions between calcium and vitamin D in relation to all-cause mortality were observed.

Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the presence of an adequate status of 25(OH)D3 in combination with an adequate magnesium intake is essential in lowering the risk of mortality in CRC patients, yet the underlying mechanism should be studied. In addition, diet and lifestyle intervention studies are needed to confirm our findings. The COLON study was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT03191110. The EnCoRe study was registered at trialregister.nl as NTR7099.

Abstract

The coordination chemistry of magnesium (Mg2+) was extensively explored. More recently; magnesium; which plays a role in over 80% of metabolic functions and governs over 350 enzymatic processes; is becoming increasingly linked to chronic disease-predominantly due to magnesium deficiency (hypomagnesemia). Supplemental dietary magnesium utilizing biorelevant chelate ligands is a proven method for counteracting hypomagnesemia. However, the coordination chemistry of such bio-relevant magnesium complexes is yet to be extensively explored or elucidated. It is the aim of this review to comprehensively describe what is currently known about common bio-relevant magnesium complexes from the perspective of coordination chemistry.

Abstract

The development of degradable bone implants, in particular made of metal materials, is an emerging field. The advantage of degradable implants is that they do not have to be removed later. In order to be able to develop and scale appropriate implants for different applications, it is necessary to know the change in mechanical properties of the implant during the degradation process in general and at different locations. One area of bone implants are bone substitute materials. They are deployed when there is a defect in the bone which cannot be filled autonomously by the body. In this study, a numerical degradation model of magnesium-based bone substitute materials is developed using the finite element method. Computational models are being developed to reduce experimental animal research in future. Magnesium is a naturally occurring material which is needed to build enzymes in the body. Additionally, magnesium has a Young's modulus close to native bone, wherefore it is attractive for medical applications with bone contact. The simulation model is based on the assumption that the degradation is a diffusion-controlled process driven by the dissolution of magnesium. The model is adapted to a 3D open-pored structure made of the magnesium alloy LAE442. Previous studies showed that implants made of LAE442 lose stiffness without a volume reduction. To simulate the change in mechanical properties, a concentration-dependent Young's modulus is assumed. With this model the formation of the degradation layer is computable as well as the change in mechanical properties, as measured by the effective Young's modulus of the structure. The movement of the interface between the not-degraded and degraded material is modelled using the level set method.

Abstract

The four member family of "Cyclin and Cystathionine β-synthase (CBS) domain divalent metal cation transport mediators", CNNMs, are the least-studied mammalian magnesium transport mediators. CNNM4 is abundant in the brain and the intestinal tract, and its abnormal activity causes Jalili Syndrome. Recent findings show that suppression of CNNM4 in mice promotes malignant progression of intestinal polyps and is linked to infertility. The association of CNNM4 with phosphatases of the regenerating liver, PRLs, abrogates its Mg2+-efflux capacity, thus resulting in an increased intracellular Mg2+ concentration that favors tumor growth. Here we present the crystal structures of the two independent intracellular domains of human CNNM4, i.e., the Bateman module and the cyclic nucleotide binding-like domain (cNMP). We also derive a model structure for the full intracellular region in the absence and presence of MgATP and the oncogenic interacting partner, PRL-1. We find that only the Bateman module interacts with ATP and Mg2+, at non-overlapping sites facilitating their positive cooperativity. Furthermore, both domains dimerize autonomously, where the cNMP domain dimer forms a rigid cleft to restrict the Mg2+ induced sliding of the inserting CBS1 motives of the Bateman module, from a twisted to a flat disk shaped dimer.

Abstract

In this work, a zirconium/magnesium-modified bentonite (ZrMgBT) was prepared and characterized by SEM, EDS, XRD and pHPZC. The performance and mechanism of phosphate adsorption onto ZrMgBT was evaluated in detail using batch experiments and 31P NMR. Results showed the adsorption isotherm data were well described by the Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich models, and the kinetic data fitted better to the pseudo-second-order kinetic model than the pseudo-first-order kinetic model. The phosphate adsorption capacity of ZrMgBT was slightly affected by the presence of Na+, K+, Cl-, [Formula: see text] and [Formula: see text], but it was enhanced by coexisting Mg2+ and [Formula: see text]. The mechanism for phosphate adsorption onto ZrMgBT at pH 7 was mainly the complexation reaction between phosphate and zirconium. In addition, ZrMgBT exhibited more excellent adherence to phosphate than zirconium-modified bentonite (ZrBT). Especially, the maximum monolayer phosphate adsorption capacity for ZrMgBT at pH 7 and 0.5 g/L of adsorbent dosage calculated based on the Langmuir isotherm model (13.0 mg P/g) was 67.5% higher than that for ZrBT. The higher phosphate adsorption capacity for ZrMgBT than ZrBT could be attributed to the higher specific surface area as well as higher Mg2+ releasing ability of the former. The enhancement of phosphate adsorption by the release of Mg2+ from ZrMgBT could be mainly due to the formation of [Formula: see text] in the solution firstly and then the adsorption of [Formula: see text] on ZrMgBT forming ≡Zr(OPO3H)Mg on the ZrMgBT surface. In general, we conclude that ZrMgBT is a more promising adsorbent for phosphate removal from aqueous solution than ZrBT.

Abstract

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with alterations in calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg), as well as circulating pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines. Anti-inflammatory drugs are commonly used as adjuvant treatments for MDD. However, no studies examined the effects of a combinatorial treatment with sertraline and ketoprofen, an anti-inflammatory drug, on Ca and Mg levels in MDD. The present study examined a) differences in both cations between drug-naïve MDD patients and controls, and b) the effects of sertraline and ketoprofen on Ca and Mg (both total and ionized). In the same patients, we also examined the associations between both cations and IL-1β, IL-4, IL-6, IL-18, IFN-γ, TGF-β1, zinc, and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO). Clinical improvement was assessed using the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) at baseline and after follow up for 2 months. Serum Ca and Mg (total and ionized) were significantly lower in MDD patients as compared with controls, while treatment significantly increased calcium but decreased magnesium levels. There were significant and inverse correlations between the BDI-II scores from baseline to endpoint and Ca (both total and ionized), but not Mg, levels. The effects of calcium on the BDI-II score remained significant after considering the effects of zinc, IDO and an immune activation z unit-weighted composite score based on the sum of all cytokines. There was a significant and inverse association between this immune activation index and calcium levels from baseline to endpoint. In conclusion, lowered levels of both cations play a role in the pathophysiology of major depression. Antidepressant-induced increases in Ca are associated with clinical efficacy and attenuation of the immune response. The suppressant effect of antidepressants on Mg levels is probably a side effect of those drugs. New antidepressant treatments should be developed that increase the levels both Ca and Mg.

Abstract

Introduction: Due to the renal handling mechanism of magnesium, prolonging the time for infusion of intravenous (IV) magnesium has been postulated to decrease magnesium requirements; however, a paucity of clinical evidence exists to support prolonging infusion rates. Objective: To assess if there is a difference in magnesium replacement required in the medicine population at an academic medical center when prolonged infusion rates (0.5 g/h) are compared to short infusion rates of > 0.5 g/h. Methods: A retrospective chart review was performed before and after implementation of the hypomagnesemia protocol (November 2015). Patients who received at least one dose of IV magnesium during hospitalization were selected from general medicine units. Primary aim was to determine if a difference exists in percent of days IV magnesium repletion required between patients receiving prolonged versus short infusion rates. Secondary objectives were to determine if a difference exists in total grams of magnesium received, percent of days magnesium levels were maintained in the optimal (1.4-2.7) and desired (2-2.7) therapeutic ranges, and incidence of hypomagnesemia (< 1.4 g/dL) and hypermagnesemia (> 2.7 g/dL). For safety, incidence of hypotension (systolic blood pressure < 90/60 mm Hg) during the magnesium infusion was recorded. Results: Totally, 45 patients were included in each cohort for a total of 90 patients to meet power. No differences existed between protocol groups for any demographic variables (all P > .05). Median infusion rate for the short infusion cohort was 1.8 g/h (range 1-2 g/h). Percent of days IV magnesium was replaced was 34.8% versus 37.8% (P = .39) in the short and prolonged infusion groups, respectively. No difference existed between groups for secondary outcomes (all P > .05). Conclusion: Prolonged magnesium infusion rates did not decrease magnesium replacement requirements. These results have been used to propose revision of our current magnesium infusion protocol to reduce infusion length.

Abstract

Objective: To our knowledge, no study has investigated the effects of choline and magnesium co-supplementation on metabolic parameters, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The aim of this study was investigation of the effects of the choline and magnesium co-supplementation on metabolic parameters, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction in patients with T2DM.Methods: A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel clinical trial was carried out among 96 diabetic patients. Ninety-six patients were randomly assigned to either choline, magnesium, choline-magnesium, or placebo for 2 months. Anthropometric measurement; metabolic, inflammatory, and endothelial markers; dietary intake; and physical activity were assessed at baseline and after treatment.Results: There was a significant change in serum magnesium in both magnesium and choline-magnesium groups (p < 0.05). Also, significant changes were observed in interleukin (IL)-6 levels in magnesium and choline-magnesium groups (p < 0.05). Moreover, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) levels decreased in choline and choline-magnesium groups (p < 0.05). When adjusted for potential confounders, inflammation and endothelial factors (IL-6 and VCAM-1) decreased significantly in the choline-magnesium group as compared to other groups (p < 0.05). Compared to baseline values there were no significant differences in all anthropometric measurements and metabolic factors among four groups (p > 0.05).Conclusions: Choline and magnesium co-supplementation was more effective in improving inflammation and endothelial dysfunction than supplementation with choline or magnesium alone.

Abstract

For the orthopedic application, the promising biodegradable magnesium alloys gained increasing attention. In order to improve the interface bonding strength and corrosion resistance of magnesium alloys, a novel ultrasonic aqueous synthesis approach was performed to produce hydroxyapatite coating on biodegradable magnesium alloys. The effect of ultrasonic time on the composition, microstructure, interface bonding strength and corrosion resistance of HA coated magnesium alloys were investigated. A dense and crack-free HA coating was synthesized by only ultrasonic cavitation for 1 h in the aqueous solution containing Ca2+ and PO43- ions and the coating was constituted of bamboo leaf-like HA staggered irregularly, which endowed magnesium alloy with a sufficient interface bonding strength of 18.1 ± 2.2 MPa. The electrochemical performance and mineralization ability of the coated magnesium alloys were carried out in the simulated body fluids. Compared with bare magnesium samples, the coated samples presented excellent corrosion resistance and could rapidly induce apatite formation after only three days of immersion in the simulated body fluid (SBF). Moreover, in the immersion test of 90 days, HA coatings could provide a long-term protection for magnesium alloy substrate, indicating that ultrasonic aqueous synthesized HA coating could be acted as a promising modified biomaterial on magnesium alloys for the orthopedic application.

Abstract

Introduction: The objective of this study was to review the current status of drug-induced hypomagnesemia and its adverse effects on cardiovascular disease (CVD) and hypertension. Since magnesium is a potent vasodilator, which modulates vasomotor tone, peripheral blood flow, and hypertension, its deficiency could have significant cardiovascular and blood pressure (BP) effects.Areas covered: Studies have shown that several factors can contribute to magnesium deficiency including age, diet, disease, and certain drugs such as diuretics and proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs). For an updated perspective of drug-induced hypomagnesemia, a Medline search of the English language literature was conducted between 2010 and 2019 using the terms diuretics, proton-pump inhibitors, hypomagnesemia, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and 35 pertinent papers were retrieved.Expert opinion: The data showed that magnesium deficiency is difficult to occur since it is plentiful in green leafy vegetables, cereals, nuts, and the drinking water. However, magnesium deficiency can occur with the use of diuretics for the treatment of hypertension and heart failure, or the use of PPIs for the treatment of gastroesophageal reflux disease. Therefore, magnesium deficiency should be detected and treated to prevent the aggravation of hypertension and the onset of CVD and serious cardiac arrhythmias including torsades de points.

Abstract

Objectives: The aim of this work is to evaluate in an in vitro setting the behavior of resorbable magnesium scaffolds (RMS) in bifurcations.

Background: As coronary bifurcations represent an important portion of all PCIs, it is crucial to understand whether RMS is applicable in these complex lesions.

Methods: Performance of RMS was evaluated with focus on bifurcations. In bifurcations RMS was tested for (1) main branch stenting with side branch opening and proximal optimization; for (2) main branch stenting with final kissing and proximal optimization; for (3) T-and-protrusion technique; for (4) string technique, which is a minimalistic version of conventional culotte technique. All tests were performed using 3.50 × 25 mm RMS. Results were evaluated by fluoroscopy, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and micro-computed tomography (μCT), for scaffold conformability, strut apposition, structural deformation and strut fracture.

Results: All planned procedural steps were performed successfully with good result according to fluoroscopy. By OCT the overall malapposition rate in bifurcation cases was 4.3%, occurring predominantly in the carinal area. No malapposition was seen at the proximal main branch confirming proper conformability of RMS. μCT analysis has shown that final kissing dilation resulted in fully stretched struts in cases, where performed with 3.5 and 3.0 mm balloons. In one case a broken connector (T-and-protrusion) and in another case, a broken strut (String technique) were identified.

Conclusions: RMS can structurally cope with bifurcations. Still, for cases and techniques where overexpansion beyond the recommended limit is needed, RMS might not be the proper device due to risk of strut fracture.

Abstract

Magnesium is an essential element to aquatic organisms and understanding the origin of Mg is important for understanding their growth. Ultimately, Mg in streams is derived from the chemical weathering of bedrock in the catchment. In this study, we used Mg stable isotope ratios (δ26Mg) to test whether stream organisms reflect lithological sources in stream catchments. In November 2017 and May 2018, we sampled aquatic insects and small gobies from six temperate streams in the Lake Biwa area (central Japan). Three of these streams had up to 38% limestone in their catchment (limestone streams), and three streams lacked limestone (non-limestone streams). We hypothesised that stream organisms from limestone streams had significantly lower δ26Mg values compared to those of the same organisms from non-limestone streams. Aquatic insects from limestone streams had an average of 0.78‰ lower δ26Mg values than those of the same organisms from non-limestone streams, thereby indicating a lithological control on the δ26Mg of aquatic insects. Aquatic insects often showed an offset to higher δ26Mg values compared to those of stream water, thereby pointing to a 26Mg-enriched diet as an additional Mg source to water and/or Mg isotope fractionation during Mg accumulation. Instead, stream water was the main Mg source for small gobies, as their bones reflected the δ26Mg of water. We concluded that δ26Mg could trace Mg sources of aquatic organisms, and the same methodology can be applied to other metals.

Abstract

Epidemiological studies on magnesium intake and primary liver cancer (PLC) are scarce, and no prospective studies have examined the associations of magnesium intake with PLC incidence and mortality. We sought to clarify whether higher magnesium intake from diet and supplements was associated with lower risks of PLC incidence and mortality in the US population. Magnesium intake from diet and supplements was evaluated through a food frequency questionnaire in a cohort of 104,025 participants. Cox regression was employed to calculate hazard ratios for PLC incidence and competing risk regression was employed to calculate subdistribution hazard ratios for PLC mortality. Restricted cubic spline regression was employed to test nonlinearity. We documented 116 PLC cases during 1,193,513.5 person-years of follow-up and 100 PLC deaths during 1,198,021.3 person-years of follow-up. Total (diet + supplements) magnesium intake was found to be inversely associated with risks of PLC incidence (hazard ratiotertile 3 vs. 1 : 0.44; 95% confidence interval: 0.24, 0.80; ptrend = 0.0065) and mortality (subdistribution hazard ratiotertile 3 vs. 1 : 0.37; 95% confidence interval: 0.19, 0.71; ptrend = 0.0008). Similar results were obtained for dietary magnesium intake. Nonlinear inverse dose-response associations with PLC incidence and mortality were observed for both total and dietary magnesium intakes (all pnonlinearity < 0.05). In summary, in the US population, a high magnesium intake is associated with decreased risks of PLC incidence and mortality in a nonlinear dose-response manner. These findings support that increasing the consumption of foods rich in magnesium may be beneficial in reducing PLC incidence and mortality.

Abstract

Background: In December 2019, the viral pandemic of respiratory illness caused by COVID-19 began sweeping its way across the globe. Several aspects of this infectious disease mimic metabolic events shown to occur during latent subclinical magnesium deficiency. Hypomagnesemia is a relatively common clinical occurrence that often goes unrecognized since magnesium levels are rarely monitored in the clinical setting. Magnesium is the second most abundant intracellular cation after potassium. It is involved in >600 enzymatic reactions in the body, including those contributing to the exaggerated immune and inflammatory responses exhibited by COVID-19 patients.

Methods: A summary of experimental findings and knowledge of the biochemical role magnesium may play in the pathogenesis of COVID-19 is presented in this perspective. The National Academy of Medicine's Standards for Systematic Reviews were independently employed to identify clinical and prospective cohort studies assessing the relationship of magnesium with interleukin-6, a prominent drug target for treating COVID-19.

Results: Clinical recommendations are given for prevention and treatment of COVID-19. Constant monitoring of ionized magnesium status with subsequent repletion, when appropriate, may be an effective strategy to influence disease contraction and progression. The peer-reviewed literature supports that several aspects of magnesium nutrition warrant clinical consideration. Mechanisms include its "calcium-channel blocking" effects that lead to downstream suppression of nuclear factor-Kβ, interleukin-6, c-reactive protein, and other related endocrine disrupters; its role in regulating renal potassium loss; and its ability to activate and enhance the functionality of vitamin D, among others.

Conclusion: As the world awaits an effective vaccine, nutrition plays an important and safe role in helping mitigate patient morbidity and mortality.

Abstract

Objectives: We tested the hypothesis that admission serum magnesium levels are associated with extent of hemorrhage in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Design: Single-center prospective observational study.

Setting: Tertiary hospital neurologic ICU.

Patients: Patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage.

Interventions: Clinically indicated CT scans and serum laboratory studies.

Measurements and main results: Demographic, clinical, laboratory, and radiographic data were analyzed. Extent of initial hemorrhage was graded semi-quantitatively on admission CT scans using the modified Fisher scale (grades: 0, no radiographic hemorrhage; 1, thin [< 1 mm in depth] subarachnoid hemorrhage; 2, thin subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular hemorrhage; 3, thick [≥ 1 mm] subarachnoid hemorrhage; 4, thick subarachnoid hemorrhage with intraventricular hemorrhage). We used both ordinal (modified Fisher scale) and dichotomized (thick vs thin subarachnoid hemorrhage) univariate and adjusted logistic regression models to assess associations between serum magnesium and radiographic subarachnoid hemorrhage severity. Data from 354 patients (mean age 55 ± 14 yr, 28.5% male, median admission Glasgow Coma Scale 14 [10-15]) were analyzed. Mean magnesium was lower in patients with thick versus thin subarachnoid hemorrhage (1.92 vs 1.99 mg/dL; p = 0.022). A monotonic trend across categories of modified Fisher scale was found using analysis of variance and Spearman rank correlation (p = 0.015 and p = 0.008, respectively). In adjusted ordinal and binary regression models, lower magnesium levels were associated with higher modified Fisher scale (odds ratio 0.33 per 1 mg/dL increase; 95% CI, 0.14-0.77; p = 0.011) and with thick subarachnoid hemorrhage (odds ratio 0.29 per 1 mg/dL increase; 95% CI, 0.10-0.78; p = 0.015).

Conclusions: These data support the hypothesis that magnesium influences hemorrhage severity in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, potentially through a hemostatic mechanism.

Abstract

Haloperidol (Hal) is an antipsychotic related to movement disorders. Magnesium (Mg) showed benefits on orofacial dyskinesia (OD), suggesting its involvement with N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDAR) since it acts blocking calcium channels. Comparisons between nifedipine (NIF; a calcium channel blocker) and Mg were performed to establish the Mg mechanism. Male rats concomitantly received Hal and Mg or NIF for 28 days, and OD behaviors were weekly assessed. Both Mg and NIF decreased Hal-induced OD. Hal increased Ca2+-ATPase activity in the striatum, and Mg reversed it. In the cortex, both Mg and NIF decreased such activity. Dopaminergic and glutamatergic immunoreactivity were modified by Hal and treatments: i) in the cortex: Hal reduced D1R and D2R, increasing NMDAR immunoreactivity. Mg and NIF reversed this Hal influence on D1R and NMDAR, while only Mg reversed Hal effects on D2R levels; ii) in the striatum: Hal decreased D2R and increased NMDAR while Mg and NIF decreased D1R and reversed the Hal-induced decreasing D2R levels. Only Mg reversed the Hal-induced increasing NMDAR levels; iii) in the substantia nigra (SN): while Hal increased D1R, D2R, and NMDAR, both Mg and NIF reversed this influence on D2R, but only Mg reversed the Hal-influence on D1R levels. Only NIF reversed the Hal effects on NMDAR immunoreactivity. These findings allow us to propose that Mg may be useful to minimize Hal-induced movement disturbances. Mg molecular mechanism seems to be involved with a calcium channel blocker because the NIF group showed less expressive effects than the Mg group.

Abstract

Perinatal brain injury is a major cause of neurological disability in both premature and term infants. In this review, we summarize the evidence behind some established neuroprotective practices such as administration of antenatal steroids, intrapartum magnesium for preterm delivery, and therapeutic hypothermia. In addition, we examine emerging practices such as delayed cord clamping, postnatal magnesium administration, recombinant erythropoietin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and finally inform the reader about novel interventions, some of which are currently in trials, such as xenon, melatonin, topiramate, allopurinol, creatine, and autologous cord cell therapy.

Abstract

Proton-pump inhibitors (PPIs) are commonly used after kidney transplantation and there is rarely an incentive to discontinue treatment. In the general population, PPI use has been associated with hypomagnesaemia. We aimed to investigate whether PPI use is associated with plasma magnesium, 24-h urinary magnesium excretion and hypomagnesaemia, in kidney transplant recipients (KTR). Plasma magnesium and 24-h urinary magnesium excretion were measured in 686 stable outpatient KTR with a functioning allograft for ≥1 year from the TransplantLines Food and Nutrition Biobank and Cohort-Study (NCT02811835). PPIs were used by 389 KTR (56.6%). In multivariable linear regression analyses, PPI use was associated with lower plasma magnesium (β: -0.02, P = 0.02) and lower 24-h urinary magnesium excretion (β: -0.82, P < 0.001). Moreover, PPI users had a higher risk of hypomagnesaemia (plasma magnesium <0.70 mmol/L), compared with non-users (Odds Ratio (OR): 2.12; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.43-3.15, P < 0.001). This risk tended to be highest among KTR taking high PPI dosages (>20 mg omeprazole Eq/day) and was independent of adjustment for potential confounders (OR: 2.46; 95% CI 1.32-4.57, P < 0.005). No interaction was observed between PPI use and the use of loop diuretics, thiazide diuretics, tacrolimus, or diabetes (Pinteraction > 0.05). These results demonstrate that PPI use is independently associated with lower magnesium status and hypomagnesaemia in KTR. The concomitant decrease in urinary magnesium excretion indicates that this likely is the consequence of reduced intestinal magnesium absorption. Based on these results, it might be of benefit to monitor magnesium status periodically in KTR on chronic PPI therapy.

Abstract

Background: Clinical practice guidelines recommend the use of antenatal magnesium sulphate for fetal neuroprotection before preterm birth at <30 weeks' gestation.

Aims: This survey assessed the use of antenatal magnesium sulphate for fetal neuroprotection to determine if use has changed since the previous survey in 2012, and to evaluate enablers and barriers to use.

Materials and methods: A questionnaire was sent to clinical leaders at 29 hospitals with a neonatal intensive care unit in Australia and New Zealand asking at what gestational ages magnesium sulphate was given, if use was audited and any enablers and barriers to use.

Results: Responses were received for 24 (83%) hospitals. The use of magnesium sulphate for fetal neuroprotection was reported as 89% (IQR 80-90%), an increase from 80% (IQR 53-90%) from the earlier survey. The majority of health professionals were reported as using magnesium sulphate at <30 weeks' gestation. The top enablers for use of magnesium sulphate were availability of pamphlets, posters, case record stickers and PowerPoint presentations. The main reasons as to why eligible women did not receive magnesium sulphate were imminent birth, the hospital being short staffed and the patient declined. The use of antenatal magnesium sulphate has been or is being audited in 11 (46%) of the hospitals.

Conclusions: Clinical leaders at institutions in Australia and New Zealand report that uptake in the use of magnesium sulphate for fetal neuroprotection has continued to increase since the earlier, bi-national survey in 2012. Barriers to the use of magnesium sulphate identified have institutional and consumer implications.

Abstract

Low serum magnesium concentrations were associated with development of renal failure. We aimed to determine whether magnesium supplementation improves renal function, insulin resistance, and metabolic profiles in patients with diabetic nephropathy. A total of 80 hypomagnesemic patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and early-stage nephropathy were recruited. Subjects received either daily magnesium oxide or placebo for 12 weeks. Biochemical and anthropometric variables were measured. Physical activity and dietary intakes were also recorded. This study was approved by the ethics committee of Isfahan University of Medical Sciences and was registered on the Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials website (IRCT registration no. IRCT201404271485N12). Serum magnesium levels were not changed significantly. Although the supplementation did not influence glycemic indices, patients in the magnesium group had greater insulin resistance compared with the placebo group after intervention (0.3 ± 2.3 μIU/mL vs. - 0.04 ± 2.05, P = 0.04). No significant changes were observed in serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, LDL, and total cholesterol/HDL cholesterol ratio. Furthermore, magnesium did not affect inflammation, serum levels of creatinine, and blood urine nitrogen. However, a marginal decrease in microalbuminuria (- 3.1 ± 2.2 mg/L vs. - 14 ± 9.9, P = 0.09) was observed. Oral magnesium supplementation slightly improved microalbuminuria but resulted in increased insulin resistance in patients with diabetic nephropathy.

Abstract

U6 RNA contains a 1 × 2-nt internal loop that folds and unfold during spliceosomal assembly and activation. The 1 × 2 loop consists of a C67•A79 base pair that forms an additional hydrogen bond upon protonation, C67•A+ 79, and uracil (U80) that coordinates the catalytically essential magnesium ions. We designed a series of RNA and DNA constructs with a 1 × 2 loop sequence contained in the ISL, and its modifications, to measure the thermodynamic effects of protonation and magnesium binding using UV-visible thermal denaturation experiments. We show that the wild-type RNA construct gains 0.43 kcal/mol in 1 M KCl upon lowering the pH from 7.5 to 5.5; the presence of magnesium ions increases its stability by 2.17 kcal/mol at pH 7.5 over 1 M KCl. Modifications of the helix closing base pairs from C-G to U•G causes a loss in protonation-dependent stability and a decrease in stability in the presence of magnesium ions, especially in the C68U construct. A79G single-nucleotide bulge loop construct showed the largest gain in stability in the presence of magnesium ions. The DNA wild-type construct shows a smaller effect on stability upon lowering the pH and in the presence of magnesium ions, highlighting differences in RNA and DNA structures. A U6 RNA 1 × 2 loop sequence is rare in the databases examined.

PMID: 32893812  DOI: 10.5414/CN110115
Abstract

Background: Dialysis patients are at increased risk for vascular calcification and cardiovascular disease. Emerging data suggests that magnesium might be protective for the vascular system in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients as well. However, only limited data is available on the elimination of magnesium through PD treatment. This study aims to evaluate the peritoneal magnesium elimination characteristics in comparison to other small solutes and the influence of peritoneal transport status.

Materials and methods: Peritoneal elimination of magnesium, blood-urea-nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine during a 4-hour peritoneal equilibration test (PET) was assessed in 30 stable PD patients. Absolute magnesium elimination was compared overall and between creatinine transport tertiles.

Results: Median age was 61 years, 50% of patients were male, 20% were on automated PD treatment. Serum magnesium was 0.84 mmol/L, and dialysate magnesium at the end of the PET was 0.57 mmol/L in the overall cohort and did not differ significantly between tertiles. The magnesium dialysate-to-plasma ratio was significantly different between the subgroups (lower tertile: median 0.60 (minimum 0.52, maximum 0.68) vs. middle tertile: 0.64 (0.58, 0.68) vs. upper tertile: 0.69 (0.67, 0.74), p &lt; 0.001). The elimination per liter of dialysis fluid was also significantly different (8.6 (6.6, 10.4) vs. 9.4 (8.0, 10.5) vs. 10.6 (0.2, 11.8) mg/L, p = 0.002), as was the absolute removal during the 4-hour dwell (18.6 (15.8, 21.2) vs. 19.4 (13.4, 24.6) vs. 22.7 (19.6, 31.9) mg, p = 0.007, respectively).

Conclusion: Peritoneal magnesium elimination is similar to small solute transport characteristics. However, the absolute differences among patients with slower and faster transport types are small. Therefore, magnesium supplementation in PD patients should be guided by serum magnesium concentrations rather than the amount of peritoneal elimination.

Abstract

Diabetic nephropathy is characterized by damage to both the glomerulus and tubulointerstitium, but relatively little is known about accompanying cell-specific changes in gene expression. We performed unbiased single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on cryopreserved human diabetic kidney samples to generate 23,980 single-nucleus transcriptomes from 3 control and 3 early diabetic nephropathy samples. All major cell types of the kidney were represented in the final dataset. Side-by-side comparison demonstrated cell-type-specific changes in gene expression that are important for ion transport, angiogenesis, and immune cell activation. In particular, we show that the diabetic thick ascending limb, late distal convoluted tubule, and principal cells all adopt a gene expression signature consistent with increased potassium secretion, including alterations in Na+/K+-ATPase, WNK1, mineralocorticoid receptor, and NEDD4L expression, as well as decreased paracellular calcium and magnesium reabsorption. We also identify strong angiogenic signatures in glomerular cell types, proximal convoluted tubule, distal convoluted tubule, and principal cells. Taken together, these results suggest that increased potassium secretion and angiogenic signaling represent early kidney responses in human diabetic nephropathy.

Abstract

The oceanic magnesium cycle is largely controlled by continental weathering and marine authigenic mineral formation, which are intimately linked to long-term climate. Uncertainties in the magnesium cycle propagate into other chemical budgets, and into interpretations of paleo-oceanographic reconstructions of seawater δ26Mg and Mg/Ca ratios. Here, we produce a detailed global map of the flux of dissolved magnesium from the ocean into deeper marine sediments (greater than ∼1 meter below seafloor), and quantify the global flux and associated isotopic fractionation. We find that this flux accounts for 15-20% of the output of magnesium from the ocean, with a flux-weighted fractionation factor of ∼0.9994 acting to increase the magnesium isotopic ratio in the ocean. Our analysis provides the best constraints to date on the sources and sinks that define the oceanic magnesium cycle, including new constraints on the output flux of magnesium and isotopic fractionation during low-temperature ridge flank hydrothermal circulation.

Abstract

β-Lactoglobulin has been shown to interact with carotenoids from sea buckthorn berries. However, previously, no studies have taken into account the effect of calcium and magnesium on the β-lactoglobulin-carotenoids complex. This study aims to determine the effect of calcium and magnesium on the interaction between β-lactoglobulin and carotenoids from sea buckthorn berries extract, during heating from the perspective of deepening interaction mechanisms as prerequisites for micro- and nanoencapsulation. Phase diagram, intrinsic fluorescence spectra, quenching experiments and synchronous spectra were employed to acquire information regarding the conformation of protein in the presence of calcium chloride and magnesium chloride. Intrinsic fluorescence data showed that, between 25°C and 60°C, the presence of calcium chloride in the complex favoured the movement of tryptophan residues to domains located at the protein-water interface, while magnesium chloride favoured the burial of tryptophan residues. Higher temperatures generated blue shifts regardless of which salt was present, suggesting exposure of tryptophan residues to the hydrophobic core of the protein. Extrinsic fluorescence intensity of the non-heat-treated complex with magnesium chloride was significantly higher (P < 0.01) than of the complex with calcium chloride, suggesting that 1-anilino-8-naphtalenesulphonic acid was bound to a higher proportion of the β-lactoglobulin-carotenoids complex. Calcium chloride increased extrinsic fluorescence to a greater extent than magnesium chloride at temperatures above 70°C and was related to small structural changes induced by preheating β-lactoglobulin.

Abstract

Background: Catheter-related bladder discomfort occurs because of involuntary contractions of the bladder smooth muscle after urinary catheterization. Magnesium is associated with smooth muscle relaxation. This study hypothesized that among patients having transurethral resection of bladder tumor, magnesium will reduce the incidence of postoperative moderate-to-severe catheter-related bladder discomfort.

Methods: In this double-blind, randomized study, patients were randomly allocated to the magnesium group (n = 60) or the control group (n = 60). In magnesium group, a 50 mg/kg loading dose of intravenous magnesium sulfate was administered for 15 min, followed by an intravenous infusion of 15 mg · kg · h during the intraoperative period. Patients in the control group similarly received normal saline. The primary outcome was the incidence of catheter-related bladder discomfort above a moderate grade at 0 h postoperatively. None, mild, moderate, and severe catheter-related bladder discomfort at 1, 2, and 6 h postoperatively, patient satisfaction, and magnesium-related adverse effects were also assessed.

Results: The incidence of catheter-related bladder discomfort above a moderate grade at 0 h postoperatively was significantly lower in the magnesium group than in the control group (13 [22%] vs. 46 [77%]; P < 0.001; relative risk = 0.283; 95% CI, 0.171 to 0.467; absolute risk reduction = 0.55; number needed to treat = 2); similar results were observed for catheter-related bladder discomfort above a moderate grade at 1 and 2 h postoperatively (5 [8%] vs. 17 [28%]; P = 0.005; relative risk = 0.294; 95% CI, 0.116 to 0.746; and 1 [2%] vs. 14 [23%]; P < 0.001; relative risk = 0.071; 95% CI, 0.010 to 0.526, respectively). Patient satisfaction on a scale from 1 to 7 was significantly higher in the magnesium group than in the control group (5.1 ± 0.8 vs. 3.5 ± 1.0; P < 0.001; 95% CI, 1.281 to 1.919). Magnesium-related adverse effects were not significantly different between groups.

Conclusions: Magnesium reduced the incidence of catheter-related bladder discomfort above a moderate grade and increased patient satisfaction among patients having transurethral resection of bladder tumor.

Abstract

Nano-bioceramic particles serving as a reinforcement can improve the mechanical and biological properties of magnesium implants, but they might have some side effects, that must be addressed. In this research, magnesium composites including 10 wt% nano-bioglass (nBG) were fabricated using powder metallurgy (PM10) and spark plasma sintering (SPS10) methods for bone reconstruction purposes. The results of the compression test indicated that the SPS10 sample had higher mechanical properties, in comparison to the PM10 sample, and nBG had more reinforcing effect on the mechanical properties of magnesium matrix. X-ray difractometery indicated that nBG was chemically reacted with magnesium in the PM10 sample, and resulted in some extra phases (MgO and Mg2Si) formation, while there was no detectable extra phases in the SPS10 sample. However, a higher in vitro degradation rate was observed for PM10 sample, because of multi-phase formation at the magnesium matrix. To inhibit the chemical reaction between magnesium and nBG kinetically, a short time sintering process can be, therefore, recommended.

Abstract

Magnesium (Mg) metal is of great interest in biomedical applications, especially in tissue engineering. Mg exhibits excellent in vivo biocompatibility, biodegradability and, during degradation, releases Mg ions (Mg2+) with the potential to improve tissue repair. We used electrospinning technology to incorporate Mg particles into nanofibers. Various ratios of Mg metal microparticles (<44 µm diameter) were incorporated into nanofiber polycaprolactone (PCL) meshes. Physicochemical properties of the meshes were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), mechanical tensile testing, X-ray diffractometry and UV-VIS spectrophotometry. Biological properties of meshes were evaluated in vitro and in vivo. Under mammalian cell culture conditions, Mg-containing meshes released hydrogen gas and relative amounts of free Mg2+ that reflected the Mg/PCL ratios. All meshes were non-cytotoxic for 3T3 fibroblasts and PC-12 pheochromocytoma cells. In vivo implantation under the skin of mice for 3, 8 and 28 days showed that Mg-containing meshes were well vascularized, with improved measures of inflammation and healing compared to meshes without Mg. Evidence included an earlier appearance and infiltration of tissue repairing macrophages and, after 28 days, evidence of more mature tissue remodeling. Thus, these new composite nanofiber meshes have promising material properties that mitigated inflammatory tissue responses to PCL alone and improved tissue healing, thus providing a suitable matrix for use in clinically relevant tissue engineering applications. STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE: The biodegradable metal, magnesium, safely biodegrades in the body, releasing beneficial byproducts. To improve tissue delivery, magnesium metal particles were incorporated into electrospun nanofiber meshes composed of a biodegradable, biocompatible polymer, polycaprolactone (PCL). Magnesium addition, at several concentrations, did not alter PCL chemistry, but did alter physical properties. Under cell culture conditions, meshes released magnesium ions and hydrogen gas and were not cytotoxic for two cell types. After implantation in mice, the mesh with magnesium resulted in earlier appearance of M2-like, reparative macrophages and improved tissue healing versus mesh alone. This is in agreement with other studies showing beneficial effects of magnesium metal and provides a new type of scaffold material that will be useful in clinically relevant tissue engineering applications.

Abstract

RNAs are involved in myriad cellular events. In general, RNA function is affected by cellular conditions. For instance, molecular crowding promotes RNA folding through compaction of the RNA. Metabolites generally destabilize RNA secondary structure, which improves RNA folding cooperativity and increases the fraction of functional RNA. Our recent studies demonstrate that cellular concentrations of amino acid-chelated magnesium (aaCM) stimulate RNA folding and catalysis while protecting RNAs from magnesium ion-induced degradation. However, effects of other cellular magnesium ion chelators on RNA function have not been tested. Herein, we report that nucleotide diphosphate-chelated magnesium, which is of intermediate strength, promotes RNA catalysis much like aaCM. Nucleotides are some of the major metabolites in cells and have one to three phosphates, which have increasingly tight binding of magnesium. On the basis of binding calculations, ∼85% ATP, ∼40% ADP, and only 5% AMP are estimated to possess a magnesium ion under cellular conditions of 0.50 mM Mg2+free. We tested the self-cleaving activity of the hammerhead ribozyme in the presence of these chelated magnesium species. Our results indicate that NTP-chelated magnesium and NMP-chelated magnesium do not appreciably stimulate RNA catalysis, whereas NDP-chelated magnesium promotes RNA catalysis up to 6.5-fold. Inspired by NDP, we observed similar stimulatory effects for several other Mg2+ diphosphate-containing metabolites, including UDP-GlcNAC and UDP-Glc; in addition, we found similar effects for a DNAzyme. Thus, rate stimulatory effects are general with respect to the diphosphate and nucleic acid enzyme. These results implicate magnesium-chelated diphosphate metabolites as general facilitators of RNA function inside cells.

Abstract

Background and purpose: Hemorrhages are a serious complication of brain surgery, and magnesium has shown hemostatic properties in hemorrhagic stroke and non-neurological surgeries. External ventricular drain (EVD) insertion is an advantageous model of emergency neurosurgical hemorrhage risk because it is common, standardized, and the operator is blinded to the outcome during the procedure. We tested the hypothesis that low magnesium is associated with risk of hemorrhagic complications from EVD insertion.

Methods: Patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage and aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage were enrolled in a prospective, observational study. Demographic and clinical variables were prospectively recorded, including serum magnesium measurements. Catheter tract hemorrhage (CTH) was measured on postoperative head computed tomography within 48 hours of EVD insertion.

Results: We observed 50 CTH among 327 EVD procedures (15.3%) distributed similarly among intracerebral hemorrhage (21/116 [18.1%]) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (29/211 [13.7%]). Magnesium was lower in patients with CTH compared with those without (median 1.8 versus 2.0 mg/dL, P<0.0001). Higher magnesium was associated with lower odds of CTH (odds ratio 0.67 per 0.1 mg/dL magnesium [95% CI, 0.56-0.78], P<0.0001) after adjustment for other risk factors, with similar effect in the intracerebral hemorrhage and subarachnoid hemorrhage subgroups. Preprocedural increase in magnesium (odds ratio 0.68 [0.52-0.85]) and dose of preprocedural magnesium sulfate (odds ratio 0.67 [0.40-0.97]) were associated with reduced CTH risk after adjustment for initial magnesium and other risk factors.

Conclusions: Lower magnesium at the time of EVD insertion was an independent predictor of hemorrhagic complications. Baseline risk was attenuated by preprocedural increases in magnesium, suggesting a therapeutic opportunity.

Abstract

This study aimed at examining trends in magnesium intake among U.S. Hispanic adults stratified by gender, Hispanic origins, age, and poverty income ratio (PIR) level. Data on 9304 Hispanic adults aged ≥20 years from eight National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cycles (1999-2014) were included in this study. For each cycle, survey-weighted mean dietary and total magnesium intakes were estimated. The prevalence of dietary and total magnesium intake below the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) was further estimated stratified by gender and age groups. Linear regression was used to test trend. Over the survey cycles, both dietary and total magnesium intakes were significantly increased among Hispanic adults. In the study period, magnesium intake tended to be lower in females, adults in other Hispanic-origin group, those aged ≥65 years old, and those with a PIR <1.0. The prevalence of magnesium intake inadequacy decreased among Hispanic adults; however, more than 70% of Hispanic males and females continued to have magnesium intake below the RDA in 2013-2014. From 1999/2000 to 2013/2014, despite several improvements in magnesium intake having been identified, additional findings showed insufficient intake in Hispanic males and females, suggesting the need to improve magnesium intake through diet and dietary supplementation for U.S. Hispanics.

The WOMED model of benign thyroid disease: Acquired magnesium deficiency due to physical and psychological stressors relates to dysfunction of oxidative phosphorylation.
Moncayo R1, Moncayo H1.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:

The aim of this study was to discern whether a relation between biochemical parameters, sonography and musculoskeletal data exists in cases of hyperthyroidism and whether they are modifiable through supplementation with selenomethionine and magnesium citrate as well as by acupuncture and manual medicine methods.
RESULTS:

A direct correlation between whole blood selenium and serum magnesium was found in subjects without thyroid disease and in menopausal women while it was reversed in cases of thyroid diseases as well as in patients with depression, infection, and in infertile women. Vascularization indices were elevated in cases of newly diagnosed benign thyroid diseases. Musculoskeletal changes i.e. lateral tension and idiopathic moving toes, as well as situations of physical and psychological stress and minor trauma and infection led to an increase of vascularization. Magnesium levels correlated negatively with these two conditions. The supplementation brought a reduction of the vascularization indices and reduced the incidence of idiopathic moving toes. Treatment of lateral tension required manual medicine methods and acupuncture (gastrocnemius). A small subgroup of patients showed a further reduction of hyper-vascularization after receiving coenzyme Q10.
CONCLUSIONS:

We interpret the elevated thyroid vascularization and low magnesium levels as signs of an inflammatory process related to the musculoskeletal changes. Improvement of thyroid function and morphology can be achieved after correcting the influence of stressors together with the supplementation regime. We hypothesize that the central biochemical event in thyroid disease is that of an acquired, altered mitochondrial function due to deficiency of magnesium, selenium, and coenzyme Q10.

Phototoxicity, Pseudoporphyria, and Photo-onycholysis Due to Voriconazole in a Pediatric Patient With Leukemia and Invasive Aspergillosis.
Willis ZI1, Boyd AS2, Di Pentima MC1.
Author information
Abstract

Voriconazole is a triazole antifungal agent superior to amphotericin B in the treatment of invasive aspergillosis. It is generally well tolerated and has excellent oral bioavailability, providing significant benefit in the treatment of invasive fungal infections. There have been numerous reports of dermatologic reactions to this agent, including erythroderma, cheilitis, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, discoid lupus erythematosus, pseudoporphyria, squamous cell carcinoma, and photosensitivity reactions. Pseudoporphyria, a dermatologic condition mimicking porphyria cutanea tarda, has been described as an adverse effect of voriconazole use. Clinical findings include photosensitivity, vesicles, bullae, milia, and scarring in sun-exposed areas. Photo-onycholysis is a phenomenon of nail discoloration and onycholysis that has been described in the setting of a phototoxic drug reaction and pseudoporphyria. Implicated drugs have most commonly been tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones, and psoralens; others have been reported as well. We report a case of a pediatric patient with leukemia who developed symptoms consistent with pseudoporphyria and later photo-onycholysis while being treated with voriconazole. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of pseudoporphyria due to voriconazole in a pediatric patient and the first reported case of photo-onycholysis as a consequence of voriconazole use.

Sein HH1, Whye Lian C2, Juan Loong K3, Sl Ng J1, Rahardjai A1, Sultan MA1.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:

This study aimed to determine the intracellular (red blood cell (RBC)) magnesium levels in children with chronic bronchial asthma and to determine the relationship between the magnesium level and peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR), type of asthma treatment, and level of asthma control.
METHODS:

A cross-sectional study was conducted at the Paediatric Clinic, Sarawak General Hospital. A total of 100 children, aged 6-12 years with chronic bronchial asthma, were recruited according to the study criteria. Venous blood samples were obtained to measure the intracellular (RBC) magnesium level using the GBC Avanta Flame Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer.
RESULTS:

Mean age was 8.57 (SD 1.18) years, and 63% of the participants were male. Mean duration of asthma was 62.2 (SD 32.3) months. A normal intracellular magnesium level was found in 95% of the participants, with a mean of 2.27 (SD 0.33) mmol/L. Two-thirds of the participants had a normal peak flow expiratory rate (> 80% of predicted value). About 85% were using both reliever and controller. Almost half of the participants (49%) had chronic asthma that was well-controlled. No significant relationship was found between magnesium level and age (r = -0.089, P = 0.379), gender (t = 0.64, P = 0.52), duration of asthma (r = -0.03, P = 0.74), PEFR (t = 0.41, P = 0.68), current level of asthma control (t = 0.02, P = 0.97), and current treatment (t = 0.414, P = 0.680).
CONCLUSION:

There was no significant intracellular magnesium deficiency in children with chronic bronchial asthma. There was no significant relationship between therapeutic medications used for treatment of children with chronic asthma and intracellular magnesium levels.

Changes in oxalate and some mineral concentrations of Setaria sphacelata under cutting and uncutting conditions.
Rahman MM, Tateyama M, Niimi M, Abdullah RB, Khadijah WE, Kawamura O.
Abstract

Oxalate concentration in forage plants is important, because it results mineral deficiency in ruminants. Data on oxalate concentration in forage plants in conjunction with cutting and uncutting conditions throughout the growing period are limited. This study was aimed to investigate the changes in oxalate and some mineral concentrations of setaria (Setaria sphacelata). The plants were harvested at different stages (vegetative, boot, pre-flowering, flowering and seed) of maturity and at about 50 cm in length of regrowth (second to sixth cuttings) for evaluation of soluble oxalate, insoluble oxalate and some mineral concentrations. Soluble oxalate and total oxalate concentrations, as well as mineral concentrations, decreased with advancing maturity. Both oxalate concentrations (soluble or insoluble) were higher in leaf compared to stem. Soluble oxalate and total oxalate concentrations of regrowth were the highest at third cutting and lowest at sixth cutting. Insoluble oxalate concentration of regrowth was almost similar in all cuttings, except for the sixth cutting. The highest concentrations of potassium, sodium and magnesium of regrowth were observed at third cutting, while the highest concentration of calcium was observed at sixth cutting. A relationship between oxalate and mineral concentrations was partially observed. Results suggest that cutting materials of setaria from June to October could achieve oxalate levels that are toxic to ruminants.

Low Hepatic Mg2+ Content promotes Liver dysmetabolism: Implications for the Metabolic Syndrome.
Voma C1, Etwebi Z2, Soltani DA2, Croniger C3, Romani A4.
Author information
Abstract

Metabolic Syndrome, a pathological condition affecting approximately 35% of the USA population, is characterized by obesity, insulin resistance, and hypertension. Metabolic syndrome is considered the single most common condition predisposing to the development of various chronic diseases including diabetes and hypertension. Hypomagnesaemia has been consistently observed in association with metabolic syndrome, but it is unclear whether reduced Mg2+ levels are the consequence or a possible cause for the development of the metabolic syndrome and/or its associated pathologies. Research performed in our laboratory showed that rats exposed for 2 weeks to a Mg2+ deficient diet presented decreased glucose accumulation into the hepatocytes together with low Mg2+ level in the circulation and within the liver cells. To better investigate the changes in glucose metabolism, HepG2 were used to mimic in vitro Mg2+ deficiency conditions. HepG2 cells cultured in low extracellular Mg2+ presented a 20% decrease in total cellular Mg2+ content, reduced glucose accumulation, and enhanced glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) transport into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). The increased G6P transport was associated with its enhanced hydrolysis by the glucose 6-phosphatase, but also conversion to 6-phosphogluconolactone by the glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The latter process resulted in the increased generation of NADPH within the ER and the increased conversion of cortisone to cortisol by the 11-β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type-1 (11-β-OHSD1). Taken together, our results provide compelling evidence that Mg2+ deficiency precedes and actually promotes some of the hepatic dysmetabolisms typical of the metabolic syndrome. The decrease in intrahepatic Mg2+ content up-regulates G6P entry into the hepatic endoplasmic reticulum and its routing into the pentose shunt pathway for energetic purposes. The associated increased in NADPH production within the ER then stimulates cortisol production, setting the conditions for hepatic insulin resistance and further altering liver metabolism.

Role of Cellular Magnesium in Human Diseases.
Long S1, Romani AM1.
Author information
Abstract

Magnesium is required for many of the major organs to function and plays a crucial role in human and mammalian physiology. Magnesium is essential for the structure of bones and teeth, acts as a cofactor for more than 300 enzymes in the body, including binding to ATP for kinase reactions, and affects permeability of excitable membranes and neuromuscular transmission. Despite these essential roles, much is still unknown about magnesium physiology and homeostasis. Currently, nutritionists believe that the general population intakes insufficient magnesium daily through the diet. The effects of magnesium deficiency are, for the most part undetected, and simple, widespread assessments of magnesium intake remain unavailable for humans. Many of the patients admitted to hospitals or medical care facilities are unaware of their low magnesium levels. Moreover, because magnesium is predominantly an intracellular cation (>99%), serum magnesium levels remain a poor predictor of tissue magnesium content and availability. This review will discuss the effects of magnesium deficiency in various pathologies affecting the human population. The underlying causes for magnesium depletion in major physiological systems will be examined along with the involved signaling pathways and the main roles of magnesium homeostasis. Where possible (e.g. alcoholism), the implications of administering supplemental magnesium will be discussed. Ultimately, this review will advocate for the necessity of identifying easy and reproducible methods to assess serum and cellular magnesium levels and to identify magnesium deficiency in order to alleviate related pathological conditions.

[Diagnostics of magnesium deficiency and measurements of magnesium concentrations in biosubstrates in norm and in various pathologies].
[Article in Russian]
Gromova OA, Kalacheva AG, Torshin IIu, Grishina TR, Semenov VA.
Abstract

In accordance with the evidence from large-scale studies magnesium deficiency has a significant negative impact on the cardiovascular system, carbohydrate and fat metabolism. Diagnosis of magnesium deficiency should be based on clinical symptoms of magnesium deficit and confirmed by additional diagnostic methods--ECG myography, bone densitometry, and quantitative determination of magnesium in various biosubstrates (whole blood, red blood cells, plasma, serum, saliva, urine, nails, hair). It is also desirable to estimate dietary intake of magnesium according to food frequency questionnaires verified by measurements of magnesium in blood. Analysis of magnesium content in blood and other biosubstrates allows to establish those perturbations of compartmentalization of magnesium in tissues that are typical for a particular pathology. It is important to emphasize that one should not confuse values of magnesium levels measured in serum and in plasma as it leads to serious errors in the diagnosis of magnesium deficiency and results in underdiagnosis of magnesium deficiency (code E61.2 of ICD-10).

A study of water hardness and the prevalence of hypomagnesaemia and hypocalcaemia in healthy subjects of Surat district (Gujarat).
Kanadhia KC1, Ramavataram DV1, Nilakhe SP1, Patel S1.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Various sources of drinking water, with varying levels of total hardness, and calcium and magnesium concentrations, are used by populations in different regions. The use of water purifiers can compound the problem of maintaining the desired levels of hardness. An inverse relationship between various conditions, including cardiovascular disease, and hard water has been reported. Until this study, investigation of the hardness of drinking water from different sources, and serum magnesium and calcium in normal subjects from the Surat district, had not been undertaken.
OBJECTIVES:

This study was performed to assess the concentrations of calcium and magnesium, and total hardness in filtered and non-filtered water and the relationship with serum magnesium and calcium levels in normal subjects consuming such water.
METHODOLOGY:

Three water samples were collected, at 15-day intervals, from 12 urban and rural areas of Surat; and also 10 different brands of bottled water. Samples were analyzed for total hardness and calcium by complexometric and EDTA methods respectively. Magnesium concentrations were obtained by subtraction of the calcium concentration from total hardness. Serum samples from healthy individuals were analyzed for magnesium and calcium using calmagite and arsenazo methods respectively. The independent t-test was used to establish significance at a level of 95%. A p-value <0.05 was considered significant.
RESULTS:

Mean total hardness, and calcium and magnesium concentrations in non-filtered, rural tube-well water were much higher than in filtered water from the same area, and the magnesium concentrations were significantly higher (p = 0.038). Filtered urban municipal had lower hardness and concentrations of calcium and magnesium (p = 0.01) compared to corresponding non-filtered water. Significantly lower levels were observed in bottled water compared to rural and urban sources of water. Serum magnesium was significantly lower in the population who were consuming filtered water compared to those drinking non-filtered water (p<0.05). No such difference was observed for serum calcium.
CONCLUSION:

Hypomagnesemia correlates with lower magnesium concentrations in drinking water (both rural tube-well and urban municipal waters), which can be attributed to the use of water purifiers. Assuming that a person consumes two liters of drinking water per day, it is estimated that there is an average loss of 160 mg (79%) of magnesium from total waterborne magnesium levels as a result of the filtration of both rural and urban water supplies. Bottled water is too hardness as in calcium and magnesium concentrations.

Is high prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency evidence for autism disorder?: In a highly endogamous population.
Bener A1, Khattab AO2, Al-Dabbagh MM3.
Author information
Abstract
AIM:

To determine the association between Vitamin D and autism, and the difference in level of Vitamin D in autism children and control.
DESIGN:

Case-control study conducted between June 2011 and May 2013, among autism at the Hamad Medical Corporation and controls at the School Health Clinics and Primary Health Care Clinics.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS:

A total of 254 cases and 254 controls. The Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic is a semi-structured, standardized assessment of social interaction, communication, play and imaginative use of materials for individuals suspected of having autism spectrum disorders. Data on clinical manifestations and laboratory, family history, body mass index (BMI) and clinical biochemistry variables including serum 25-hydroxy Vitamin D, calcium, phosphorus and magnesium were obtained. Univariate and multivariate statistical analyzes were performed.
RESULTS:

Of the total number of 508 children surveyed, 254 of autism and 254 of healthy children were contacted. The mean age (± standard deviation, in years) for autism versus control children was 5.51 ± 1.58 versus 5.76 ± 1.56. There were statistically significant differences between autism and healthy children control subjects with respect to educational level of mother (P = 0.016); occupation of mother (P = 0.005); BMI (P < 0.001); consanguinity (P = 0.015); exposure to sun (P = 0.002) and walking time per day <60 min (P < 0.001). The mean value of Vitamin D in autism children was much lower than the normal value, and there was a significant difference found in the mean values of Vitamin D between autism (18.39 ± 8.2 with median 18) and versus control children (21.59 ± 8.4) (P < 0.0001) and with median 21 (P = 0.004). Besides mean values of calcium, phosphorous, magnesium, glucose, potassium and alkaline phosphate were statistically significant higher in control healthy children compared to autism children (P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the mean serum Vitamin D level, calcium, consanguinity, BMI, physical activity, child order, and ferritin, were considered as the main factors associated with autism. Of total 254 of autism children, 14.2% had severe Vitamin D deficiency (<10 ng/ml), 43.7% had moderate insufficient levels (between 10 and 20 ng/ml), 28.3% had mild insufficient levels (between 20 and 30 ng/ml), and only 13.8% of autism had sufficient levels (>30 ng/ml). Similarly, of the total 254 of healthy children 8.3% had severe Vitamin D deficiency (<10 ng/ml), 37% had moderate insufficient levels (between 10 and 20 ng/ml), 37.4% had mild insufficient levels (between 20 and 30 ng/ml), and only 17.3% had sufficient levels (>30 ng/ml). Furthermore, there was statistically significant differences between autism and control subjects with respect to the serum level of Vitamin D (P = 0.023).
CONCLUSION:

The present study revealed that Vitamin D deficiency was higher in autism children compared to healthy children and supplementing infants with Vitamin D might be a safe and more effective strategy for reducing the risk of autism.

Photosynthetic capacity, nutrient status, and growth of maize (Zea mays L.) upon MgSO4 leaf-application.
Jezek M1, Geilfus CM1, Bayer A1, Mühling KH1.
Author information
Abstract

The major plant nutrient magnesium (Mg) is involved in numerous physiological processes and its deficiency can severely reduce the yield and quality of crops. Since Mg availability in soil and uptake into the plant is often limited by unfavorable soil or climatic conditions, application of Mg onto leaves, the site with highest physiological Mg demand, might be a reasonable alternative fertilization strategy. This study aimed to investigate, if MgSO4 leaf-application in practically relevant amounts can efficiently alleviate the effects of Mg starvation in maize, namely reduced photosynthesis capacity, disturbed ion homeostasis and growth depression. Results clearly demonstrated that Mg deficiency could be mitigated by MgSO4 leaf-application as efficiently as by resupply of MgSO4 via the roots in vegetative maize plants. Significant increases in SPAD values and net rate of CO2-assimilation as well as enhanced shoot biomass have been achieved. Ion analysis furthermore revealed an improvement of the nutrient status of Mg-deficient plants with regard to [Mg], [K], and [Mn] in distinct organs, thereby reducing the risk of Mn-toxicity at the rootside, which often occurs together with Mg deficiency on acid soils. In conclusion, foliar fertilization with Mg proved to be an efficient strategy to adequately supply maize plants with Mg and might hence be of practical relevance to correct nutrient deficiencies during the growing season.

Balik M1, Zakharchenko M, Leden P, Otahal M, Rulisek J, Brodska H, Stritesky M.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Testing metabolic effects of a novel calcium-free, magnesium, phosphate and lactate containing solution (Lactocitrate) in combination with citrate anticoagulation.
METHODS:

Patients on CRRT (2,000 ml/h, blood flow (Qb) 100 ml/min, trisodium citrate (4% TSC)) with arterial lactate <3 mmol/l were included. At start, bicarbonate-buffered fluid was changed to Lactocitrate and the substitution of magnesium and phosphorus ceased. At 9 h the Qb was increased to 150 ml/min. At 18 h the CRRT dosage was increased to 3,000 ml/h.
RESULTS:

In 22 CVVHDF patients and another 23 on CVVH the pH, aHCO3 and Na (all p > 0.05) showed no significant changes regardless of the increased dosage of 4% TSC at 9 h (p < 0.001). Mgtot and phosphorus stabilised within normal range. Arterial lactate increased to 1.9 (1.6-2.6) mmol/l at 3,000 ml/h, p < 0.001). Citrate- and lactate-related energetic gains were up to 74 (61-86) kJ/h.
CONCLUSIONS:

The fluid performed well within ordinary CRRT dosage and Qb up to 150 ml/min. Lactate levels mildly increased and no magnesium and phosphorus replenishments were necessary.

Lower serum magnesium is associated with cardiovascular risk factors and mortality in haemodialysis patients.
João Matias P1, Azevedo A, Laranjinha I, Navarro D, Mendes M, Ferreira C, Amaral T, Jorge C, Aires I, Gil C, Ferreira A.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Hypomagnesaemia is a cardiovascular (CV) risk factor in the general population. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between pre-dialysis magnesium (Mg) and CV risk markers, [including pulse pressure (PP), left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and vascular calcifications (VC)], and mortality in haemodialysis (HD) patients.
METHODS:

We performed a 48-month prospective study in 206 patients under pre-dilution haemodiafiltration with a dialysate Mg concentration of 1 mmol/l.
RESULTS:

Lower Mg concentrations were predictors of an increased PP (≥65 mm Hg) (p = 0.002) and LVMI (≥140 g/m(2)) (p = 0.03) and of a higher VC score (≥3) (p = 0.01). Patients with Mg <1.15 mmol/l had a lower survival at the end of the study (p = 0.01). Serum Mg <1.15 mmol/l was an independent predictor of all-cause (p = 0.01) and CV mortality (p = 0.02) when adjusted for multiple CV risk factors.
CONCLUSIONS:

Lower Mg levels seem to be associated with increased CV risk markers, like PP, LVMI and VC, and with higher mortality in HD patients.

Abstract

The recent flurry of apparently conflicting research findings is likely to have left practitioners, if not at a loss, at least bemused about this topic. How best should the midwife advise the childbearing woman on the subject of magnesium supplementation during pregnancy? It is possible that the recent welter of words may not have been of very much help to any of those who read them. In this paper I suggest that the researchers may actually be missing the point as far as providing useful and usable data is concerned.

The paradox of the contrasting roles of chronic magnesium deficiency in metabolic disorders and field cancerization.
Rubin H1.
Author information
Abstract

Magnesium (Mg(2+)) deficiency is common in metabolic disorders such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and insulin resistance. These disorders are also associated with a high incidence of cancer. Mg(2+) is the regulator par excellence of metabolism, largely through its role as a cofactor for all phosphoryl transfers in the cell. Because Mg(2+) deficiency inhibits energy production it might be expected to inhibit tumor production. However, the high incidence of cancer in metabolic disorders makes that seem unlikely. In order to understand this seeming paradox, it is important to understand the regulatory role of Mg(2+) in normal and neoplastic cells. Free Mg(2+) is the primary regulator of glycolysis and the Krebs cycle. It also acts as a second messenger for growth factors in regulating protein synthesis. Varying Mg(2+) concentrations result in the same set of coordinated responses as varying serum concentrations. Selection by serial rounds of high cell density or reduced serum concentration at low cell density results in progressive stages of field cancerization. Highly transformed cells proliferate in much lower concentrations of Mg(2+) and grow to much higher saturation densities than normal cells. It remains to be seen whether reduction in Mg(2+) in sparse, exponentially proliferating cultures selects for increases in saturation density and transformed foci.

Antioxidant response and carboxylate metabolism in Brassica rapa exposed to different external Zn, Ca, and Mg supply.
Blasco B1, Graham NS2, Broadley MR2.
Author information
Abstract

Zinc (Zn), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) malnutrition are common deficiencies in many developed and developing countries, resulting in a widespread health problem. Biofortification of food crops is an agricultural strategy that can be used to increase the levels of these elements in the edible portions of crops. Deficiency or toxicity of these cations in soils reduces plant growth, crop yield, and the quality of plant foodstuff. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of external Zn, Ca, and Mg supply on accumulation and distribution of this elements as well as antioxidant response and organic acid composition of Brassica rapa ssp. trilocularis line R-o-18. Plants were grown at low Zn (0.05 μM Zn) and high Zn (500 μM Zn), low Ca (0.4 mM) and high Ca (40 mM), and low Mg (0.2 mM), and high Mg (20 mM) to simulate deficiency and toxicity conditions. Larger shoot biomass reductions were observed under high Zn, Ca and Mg treatments, and superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), H2O2, malondialdehyde (MDA), and total ascorbate (AA) showed a marked increase in these treatments. Therefore, Brassica plants might be more sensitive to excess of these elements in the nutrient solution. The translocation factor (TF) and distribution coefficient (DC) values of Zn, Ca, and Mg indicated higher translocation and accumulation in deficient conditions. High biosynthesis and citrate content in Brassica plants may be associated mainly with a high-nutrient solution extraction ability of these plants. These results provide background data, which will be used to characterize TILLING mutants to study the effects of mutations in genes involved in regulating Zn, Ca, and Mg distribution and accumulation in plants.

Thiamine and magnesium deficiencies: keys to disease.
Lonsdale D1.
Author information
Abstract

Thiamine deficiency (TD) is accepted as the cause of beriberi because of its action in the metabolism of simple carbohydrates, mainly as the rate limiting cofactor for the dehydrogenases of pyruvate and alpha-ketoglutarate, both being critical to the action of the citric acid cycle. Transketolase, dependent on thiamine and magnesium, occurs twice in the oxidative pentose pathway, important in production of reducing equivalents. Thiamine is also a cofactor in the dehydrogenase complex in the degradation of the branched chain amino acids, leucine, isoleucine and valine. In spite of these well accepted facts, the overall clinical effects of TD are still poorly understood. Because of the discovery of 2-hydroxyacyl-CoA lyase (HACL1) as the first peroxisomal enzyme in mammals found to be dependent on thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) and the ability of thiamine to bind with prion protein, these factors should improve our clinical approach to TD. HACL1 has two important roles in alpha oxidation, the degradation of phytanic acid and shortening of 2-hydroxy long-chain fatty acids so that they can be degraded further by beta oxidation. The downstream effects of a lack of efficiency in this enzyme would be expected to be critical in normal brain metabolism. Although TD has been shown experimentally to produce reversible damage to mitochondria and there are many other causes of mitochondrial dysfunction, finding TD as the potential biochemical lesion would help in differential diagnosis. Stresses imposed by infection, head injury or inoculation can initiate intermittent cerebellar ataxia in thiamine deficiency/dependency. Medication or vaccine reactions appear to be more easily initiated in the more intelligent individuals when asymptomatic marginal malnutrition exists. Erythrocyte transketolase testing has shown that thiamine deficiency is widespread. It is hypothesized that the massive consumption of empty calories, particularly those derived from carbohydrate and fat, results in a high calorie/thiamine ratio as a major cause of disease. Because mild to moderate TD results in pseudo hypoxia in the limbic system and brainstem, emotional and stress reflexes of the autonomic nervous system are stimulated and exaggerated, producing symptoms often diagnosed as psychosomatic disease. If the biochemical lesion is recognized at this stage, the symptoms are easily reversible. If not, and the malnutrition continues, neurodegeneration follows and results in a variety of chronic brain diseases. Results from acceptance of the hypothesis could be tested by performing erythrocyte transketolase tests to pick out those with TD and supplementing the affected individuals with the appropriate dietary supplements.

Influence of microelement concentration on the intensity of alcohol withdrawal syndrome.
Prior PL1, Vaz MJ2, Ramos AC1, Galduróz JC3.
Author information
Abstract
AIMS:

To establish a nutritional and constitutional profile concerning the micronutrient plasma concentration of patients who suffer from AWS.
METHOD:

Observational case control study to determine whether patients who exhibited symptoms of AWS (N = 60) had micronutrient plasmatic concentration deficiencies when compared with healthy controls (N = 34).
RESULTS:

There were statistically significant differences between the concentrations of nutrients that are correlated with glutamate hyperactivity (zinc, magnesium and folate/vitamin B12/homocysteine).
CONCLUSION:

Evidence from literature and our experiment suggests that brain activity, especially the glutamatergic system, might be directly involved in micronutrient concentrations. Therefore, their supplementation to the AWS patient might improve symptom evolution.

Elucidating the role of the TRPM7 alpha-kinase: TRPM7 kinase inactivation leads to magnesium deprivation resistance phenotype in mice.
Ryazanova LV1, Hu Z1, Suzuki S2, Chubanov V3, Fleig A2, Ryazanov AG1.
Author information
Abstract

TRPM7 is an unusual bi-functional protein containing an ion channel covalently linked to a protein kinase domain. TRPM7 is implicated in regulating cellular and systemic magnesium homeostasis. While the biophysical properties of TRPM7 ion channel and its function are relatively well characterized, the function of the TRPM7 enzymatically active kinase domain is not understood yet. To investigate the physiological role of TRPM7 kinase activity, we constructed mice carrying an inactive TRPM7 kinase. We found that these mice were resistant to dietary magnesium deprivation, surviving three times longer than wild type mice; also they displayed decreased chemically induced allergic reaction. Interestingly, mutant mice have lower magnesium bone content compared to wild type mice when fed regular diet; unlike wild type mice, mutant mice placed on magnesium-depleted diet did not alter their bone magnesium content. Furthermore, mouse embryonic fibroblasts isolated from TRPM7 kinase-dead animals exhibited increased resistance to magnesium deprivation and oxidative stress. Finally, electrophysiological data revealed that the activity of the kinase-dead TRPM7 channel was not significantly altered. Together, our results suggest that TRPM7 kinase is a sensor of magnesium status and provides coordination of cellular and systemic responses to magnesium deprivation.

Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Thiamine plays a critical role in energy metabolism. Critically ill patients may have thiamine deficiency and increased mortality due to potentially irreversible consequences. The aim of this study was to show the impact of thiamine deficiency in a series of patients and the rapid response to thiamine replacement, showing the changes in clinical and metabolic conditions over time.
METHODS:

We described 3 cases of hospitalized patients who had received parenteral nutrition (PN) without vitamin supplementation. All the patients were admitted to the ICU between 2010 and 2011 with a severe form of lactic acidosis, an unstable circulatory state, and a different neurological disorder (a lethargic state, a severe form of impaired near-coma consciousness, and Wernicke encephalopathy).
RESULTS:

Intravenous (IV) administration of thiamine was associated with a rapid and marked restoration of acid-base balance, hemodynamic stability and the disappearance of neurological disturbances, and normalization of the clinical and biochemical conditions of all the patients within the following hours.
CONCLUSIONS:

The 3 cases demonstrated the rapidity of the reversal of severe thiamine deficiency, achieved by appropriate replacement in different hospitalized patients. The regression of clinical and biochemical disorders requires a prompt diagnosis and treatment based on the IV administration of thiamine and magnesium sulfate. In hospitalized patients at risk, thiamine deficiency is prevented by the integration of thiamine supplementation into PN and other forms of nutrition support.

Abstract

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of blood lead (Pb) levels with copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and hemoglobin (Hb) in children aged from 0-6 years in Wuhan, China. A total of 1047 children from six communities, which were randomly selected in Wuhan city and three communities, located in the urban area and others in the suburban area, were recruited for this study between November 2012 and July 2013. The levels of elements in the blood were detected using an atomic absorption spectrometer, and Hb level was tested by an automated hematology analyzer. The results showed that the mean blood lead level (BLL) is 33.72 ± 19.03 μg/L. The BLL was significantly higher among boys than girls (P < 0.05). Higher BLL was also observed in suburbs compared to that in urban areas (P < 0.05). The BLL and Zn level were gradually increased with age. The elevated rate of BLL in children was 20.9 %, while the Zn deficiency rate was 65.0 %. And, the level of Hb in higher BLL group was significantly lower. Negative correlations of the blood levels of Pb with those of Cu (r = -0.087, P = 0.005), Mg (r = -0.102, P = 0.001), and Fe (r = -0.091, P = 0.003) were observed. These data suggested that the elevated rate of BLL in children from Wuhan is still higher according to the updated reference values in the USA. The deficiency of Cu, Mg, and Fe may indicate the elevation of lead absorption. The dietary supplement of Zn, Ca, and Fe in children requires more attention.

Wernicke encephalopathy in children and adolescents.
Lallas M1, Desai J.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Wernicke encephalopathy is caused by thiamine (vitamin B1) deficiency. It is generally considered to be a disease of adult alcoholics. However, it is known to occur in the pediatric population and in non-alcoholic conditions.
DATA SOURCES:

We searched PubMed with the key words Wernicke, thiamine, pediatric, children and adolescents and selected publications that were deemed appropriate.
RESULTS:

The global prevalence rates of hunger, poverty and resultant nutrient deprivation have decreased in the 21st century. However, several scenarios which may predispose to Wernicke encephalopathy may be increasingly prevalent in children and adolescents such as malignancies, intensive care unit stays and surgical procedures for the treatment of obesity. Other predisposing conditions include magnesium deficiency and defects in the SLC19A3 gene causing thiamine transporter-2 deficiency. The classic triad consists of encephalopathy, oculomotor dysfunction and gait ataxia but is not seen in a majority of patients. Treatment should be instituted immediately when the diagnosis is suspected clinically without waiting for laboratory confirmation. Common magnetic resonance findings include symmetric T2 hyperintensities in dorsal medial thalamus, mammillary bodies, periaqueductal gray matter, and tectal plate.
CONCLUSIONS:

Wernicke encephalopathy is a medical emergency. Delay in its recognition and treatment may lead to significant morbidity, irreversible neurological damage or even death. This article aims to raise the awareness of this condition among pediatricians.

An evidence-based review of oral magnesium supplementation in the preventive treatment of migraine.
Teigen L1, Boes CJ2.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Migraine is an incompletely understood, debilitating disorder that lacks a universally effective treatment. Magnesium participates in a variety of biochemical processes related to migraine pathophysiology, and a deficiency could contribute to migraine development.
METHODS:

A review of the literature from 1990 to the present on magnesium and migraine was conducted.
REVIEW:

The authors identified 16 studies aimed at magnesium status assessment in migraine, and four intervention trials assessing the efficacy of oral magnesium supplementation, independent of other therapies, in the prevention of migraine.
CONCLUSION:

The strength of evidence supporting oral magnesium supplementation is limited at this time. With such limited evidence, a more advantageous alternative to magnesium supplementation, in patients willing to make lifestyle changes, may be to focus on increasing dietary magnesium intake.

Risks of rapid decline renal function in patients with type 2 diabetes.
Sheen YJ1, Sheu WH1.
Author information
Abstract

Progressive rising population of diabetes and related nephropathy, namely, diabetic kidney disease and associated end stage renal disease has become a major global public health issue. Results of observational studies indicate that most diabetic kidney disease progresses over decades; however, certain diabetes patients display a rapid decline in renal function, which may lead to renal failure within months. Although the definition of rapid renal function decline remained speculative, in general, it is defined by the decrease of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) in absolute rate of loss or percent change. Based on the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes 2012 clinical practice guidelines, a rapid decline in renal function is defined as a sustained decline in eGFR of > 5 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) per year. It has been reported that potential factors contributing to a rapid decline in renal function include ethnic/genetic and demographic causes, smoking habits, increased glycated hemoglobin levels, obesity, albuminuria, anemia, low serum magnesium levels, high serum phosphate levels, vitamin D deficiency, elevated systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity values, retinopathy, and cardiac autonomic neuropathy. This article reviews current literatures in this area and provides insight on the early detection of diabetic subjects who are at risk of a rapid decline in renal function in order to develop a more aggressive approach to renal and cardiovascular protection.

Abstractin English, Spanish

Minerals are essential nutrients for the body, are of inorganic nature which gives them the characteristic of being resistant to heat, are involved in a lot of chemical reactions in metabolism, regulating electrolyte balance, in maintaining bone, in the process of blood clotting and the transmission of nerve impulses, particularly its role as enzyme cofactors confers a key role in various physiological processes. Glucose homeostasis involves a fine coordination of events where hormonal control by insulin plays a key role. However, the role of minerals like magnesium, zinc, chromium, iron and selenium in the diabetes is less obvious and in some cases may be controversial. This review shows the knowledge of these five elements and their correlation with diabetes.

Abstract

XMEN disease (X-linked immunodeficiency with Magnesium defect, Epstein-Barr virus infection and Neoplasia) is a novel primary immune deficiency caused by mutations in MAGT1 and characterised by chronic infection with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), EBV-driven lymphoma, CD4 T-cell lymphopenia, and dysgammaglobulinemia [1]. Functional studies have demonstrated roles for magnesium as a second messenger in T-cell receptor signalling [1], and for NKG2D expression and consequently NK- and CD8 T-cell cytotoxicity [2]. 7 patients have been described in the literature; the oldest died at 45 years and was diagnosed posthumously [1-3]. We present the case of a 58-year-old Caucasian gentleman with a novel mutation in MAGT1 with the aim of adding to the phenotype of this newly described disease by detailing his clinical course over more than 20 years.

Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Low-grade inflammation is the link between obesity and insulin resistance. Because physiologic insulin resistance occurs at puberty, obese pubertal children are at higher risk for insulin resistance. Excessive diets in refined carbohydrates and saturated fats are risk factors for insulin resistance, but calcium, magnesium, vitamin-D, and the omega-3 fatty acids likely protect against inflammation and insulin resistance.
OBJECTIVE:

To analyze interactions among dietary saturated fat, refined carbohydrates, calcium, magnesium, vitamin D, and omega-3 fatty acids on the risk of inflammation and insulin resistance in a sample of prepubertal and pubertal children.
METHODS:

A sample of 229 children from Mexico City was analyzed in a cross-sectional design. Anthropometric measurements, 24 h recall questionnaires, and blood samples were obtained. Serum insulin, glucose, calcium, magnesium, 25-OHD3, C-reactive protein, leptin, adiponectin, and erythrocytes fatty acids were measured. Parametric and nonparametric statistics were used for analysis.
RESULTS:

While mean macronutrients intake was excessive, micronutrients intake was deficient (P < 0.01). Inflammation determinants were central obesity and magnesium-deficient diets. Determinants of insulin resistance were carbohydrates intake and circulating magnesium and adiponectin.
CONCLUSIONS:

Magnesium-deficient diets are determinants of inflammation, while high intake of refined carbohydrates is a risk factor for insulin resistance, independently of central adiposity.

Opposite extremes in ethylene/nitric oxide ratio induce cell death in suspension culture and root apices of tomato exposed to salt stress.
Poór P1, Borbély P1, Kovács J1, Papp A1, Szepesi Á1, Takács Z1, Tari I1.
Author information
Abstract

The plant hormone ethylene or the gaseous signalling molecule nitric oxide (NO) may enhance salt stress tolerance by maintaining ion homeostasis, first of all K+/Na+ ratio of tissues. Ethylene and NO accumulation increased in the root apices and suspension culture cells of tomato at sublethal salt stress caused by 100 mM NaCl, however, the induction phase of programmed cell death (PCD) was different at lethal salt concentration. The production of ethylene by root apices and the accumulation of NO in the cells of suspension culture did not increase during the initiation of PCD after 250 mM NaCl treatment. Moreover, cells in suspension culture accumulated higher amount of reactive oxygen species which, along with NO deficiency contributed to cell death induction. The absence of ethylene in the apical root segments and the absence of NO accumulation in the cell suspension resulted in similar ion disequilibrium, namely K+/Na+ ratio of 1.41 ± 0.1 and 1.68 ± 0.3 in intact plant tissues and suspension culture cells, respectively that was not tolerated by tomato.

Hypocalcemia secondary to hypomagnesemia in a patient with Crohn's disease.
Mukai A1, Yamamoto S, Matsumura K.
Author information
Abstract

A 42-year-old female with Crohn's disease who had previously undergone multiple surgical interventions developed marked hypocalcemia, which could not be resolved with calcium administration. Markedly reduced serum magnesium levels were also observed. After intravenous magnesium administration, serum calcium levels rapidly normalized. In addition, the plasma levels of intact parathyroid hormone increased immediately after magnesium administration. These data strongly suggest that hypocalcemia resulted from disturbance of appropriate parathyroid hormone secretion caused by hypomagnesemia. After introduction of infliximab therapy, her abdominal symptoms and endoscopic findings improved, and serum calcium and magnesium levels stabilized within the normal range without magnesium administration.

SERUM magnesium levels as an indicator of status of Diabetes Mellitus type 2.
Ramadass S1, Basu S2, Srinivasan AR3.
Author information
Abstract
CONTEXT:

Magnesium deficiency is commonly associated with endocrine and metabolic disorders, especially with Diabetes Mellitus type 2 though the mechanism of hypomagnesemia in Diabetes Mellitus is not completely known. There is a close association between metabolic control of Diabetes Mellitus and impaired magnesium balance.
AIMS:

To estimate the serum levels of magnesium in patients of with Diabetes Mellitus type 2 and to find a correlation if any, with the duration and control (by estimating HbA1c) of Diabetes Mellitus type 2.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:

Fifty patients of Diabetes Mellitus type 2 were included in the study. Blood samples were analyzed for fasting and post prandial glucose, HbA1c and magnesium. The patients were grouped into three categories based upon their HbA1c levels into those with good control, need intervention and poor control. The three groups were compared with reference to their mean levels of blood glucose and magnesium. Association of serum magnesium levels with HbA1c, Fasting and postprandial blood glucose and duration of Diabetes Mellitus was also done.
RESULTS:

Serum magnesium levels were found to decline with rise in HbA1c levels and with duration of Diabetes Mellitus type 2.
CONCLUSION:

Hypomagnesemia is linked to poor control of Diabetes Mellitus type 2 and depletion of serum magnesium occurs exponentially with duration of disease.

Soil type influences crop mineral composition in Malawi.
Joy EJ1, Broadley MR2, Young SD2, Black CR2, Chilimba AD3, Ander EL4, Barlow TS4, Watts MJ5.
Author information
Abstract

Food supply and composition data can be combined to estimate micronutrient intakes and deficiency risks among populations. These estimates can be improved by using local crop composition data that can capture environmental influences including soil type. This study aimed to provide spatially resolved crop composition data for Malawi, where information is currently limited. Six hundred and fifty-two plant samples, representing 97 edible food items, were sampled from >150 sites in Malawi between 2011 and 2013. Samples were analysed by ICP-MS for up to 58 elements, including the essential minerals calcium (Ca), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), magnesium (Mg), selenium (Se) and zinc (Zn). Maize grain Ca, Cu, Fe, Mg, Se and Zn concentrations were greater from plants grown on calcareous soils than those from the more widespread low-pH soils. Leafy vegetables from calcareous soils had elevated leaf Ca, Cu, Fe and Se concentrations, but lower Zn concentrations. Several foods were found to accumulate high levels of Se, including the leaves of Moringa, a crop not previously been reported in East African food composition data sets. New estimates of national dietary mineral supplies were obtained for non-calcareous and calcareous soils. High risks of Ca (100%), Se (100%) and Zn (57%) dietary deficiencies are likely on non-calcareous soils. Deficiency risks on calcareous soils are high for Ca (97%), but lower for Se (34%) and Zn (31%). Risks of Cu, Fe and Mg deficiencies appear to be low on the basis of dietary supply levels.

Author information
Abstract

The soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] chlorophyll-deficient line MinnGold is a spontaneous mutant characterized by yellow foliage. Map-based cloning and transgenic complementation revealed that the mutant phenotype is caused by a nonsynonymous nucleotide substitution in the third exon of a Mg-chelatase subunit gene (ChlI1a) on chromosome 13. This gene was selected as a candidate for a different yellow foliage mutant, T219H (Y11y11), that had been previously mapped to chromosome 13. Although the phenotypes of MinnGold and T219H are clearly distinct, sequencing of ChlI1a in T219H identified a different nonsynonymous mutation in the third exon, only six base pairs from the MinnGold mutation. This information, along with previously published allelic tests, were used to identify and clone a third yellow foliage mutation, CD-5, which was previously mapped to chromosome 15. This mutation was identified in the ChlI1b gene, a paralog of ChlI1a. Sequencing of the ChlI1b allele in CD-5 identified a nonsynonymous substitution in the third exon that confers an identical amino acid change as the T219H substitution at ChlI1a. Protein sequence alignments of the two Mg-chelatase subunits indicated that the sites of amino acid modification in MinnGold, T219H, and CD-5 are highly conserved among photosynthetic species. These results suggest that amino acid alterations in this critical domain may create competitive inhibitory interactions between the mutant and wild-type ChlI1a and ChlI1b proteins.

The emerging role of redox-sensitive Nrf2-Keap1 pathway in diabetes.
Bhakkiyalakshmi E1, Sireesh D2, Rajaguru P3, Paulmurugan R4, Ramkumar KM5.
Author information
Abstract

The pathogenic processes involving in the development of diabetes range from autoimmune destruction of pancreatic β-cells with consequent insulin deficiency to abnormalities that result in resistance to insulin action. The major contributing factor for excessive β-cell death includes oxidative stress-mediated mitochondrial damage, which creates an imbalance in redox homeostasis. Yet, β-cells have evolved adaptive mechanisms to endure a wide range of stress conditions to safeguard its potential functions. These include 'Nrf2/Keap1' pathway, a key cellular defense mechanism, to combat oxidative stress by regulating phase II detoxifying and antioxidant genes. During diabetes, redox imbalance provokes defective Nrf2-dependent signaling and compromise antioxidant capacity of the pancreas which turnout β-cells to become highly vulnerable against various insults. Hence, identification of small molecule activators of Nrf2/Keap1 pathway remains significant to enhance cellular defense to overcome the burden of oxidative stress related disturbances. This review summarizes the molecular mechanism behind Nrf2 activation and the impact of Nrf2 activators in diabetes and its complications.

Author information
Abstract

The aim of this study was to investigate the sources of drinking water for Derebogazi Village, Kahramanmaras Province, Turkey, in terms of hydrogeochemistry, isotope geochemistry, and medical geology. Water samples were obtained from seven different water sources in the area, all of which are located within quartzite units of Paleozoic age, and isotopic analyses of (18)O and (2)H (deuterium) were conducted on the samples. Samples were collected from the region for 1 year. Water quality of the samples was assessed in terms of various water quality parameters, such as temperature, pH, conductivity, alkalinity, trace element concentrations, anion-cation measurements, and metal concentrations, using ion chromatography, inductively coupled plasma (ICP) mass spectrometry, ICP-optical emission spectrometry techniques. Regional health surveys had revealed that the heights of local people are significantly below the average for the country. In terms of medical geology, the sampled drinking water from the seven sources was deficient in calcium and magnesium ions, which promote bone development. Bone mineral density screening tests were conducted on ten females using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry to investigate possible developmental disorder(s) and potential for mineral loss in the region. Of these ten women, three had T-scores close to the osteoporosis range (T-score < -2.5).

Author information
Abstract

Lithium (Li) toxicity in plants is, at a minimum, a function of Li(+) concentration, exposure time, species and growth conditions. Most plant studies with Li(+) focus on short-term acute exposures. This study examines short- and long-term effects of Li(+) exposure in Arabidopsis with Li(+) uptake studies and measured shoot mRNA transcript abundance levels in treated and control plants. Stress, pathogen-response and arabinogalactan protein genes were typically more up-regulated in older (chronic, low level) Li(+)-treatment plants and in the much younger plants from acute high-level exposures. The gene regulation behavior of high-level Li(+) resembled prior studies due to its influence on: inositol synthesis, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthases and membrane ion transport. In contrast, chronically-exposed plants had gene regulation responses that were indicative of pathogen, cold, and heavy-metal stress, cell wall degradation, ethylene production, signal transduction, and calcium-release modulation. Acute Li(+) exposure phenocopies magnesium-deficiency symptoms and is associated with elevated expression of stress response genes that could lead to consumption of metabolic and transcriptional energy reserves and the dedication of more resources to cell development. In contrast, chronic Li(+) exposure increases expression signal transduction genes. The identification of new Li(+)-sensitive genes and a gene-based "response plan" for acute and chronic Li(+) exposure are delineated.

Mineral profile of Spanish commercial baby food.
Mir-Marqués A1, González-Masó A1, Cervera ML2, de la Guardia M1.
Author information
Abstract

Commercial baby foods are an important part of the daily intake of babies from 6 to 12 months. The mineral profile of commercial baby foods in Spain was determined to establish levels of essential and non-essential elements, and their contribution to adequate intake (AI) and estimated average requirement (EAR). Thirty-five jars of commercial foods containing meat, fish, vegetables and fruit were obtained from the Spanish market and the mineral composition determined for 14 elements. In general, the baby foods analysed were sufficient for an adequate mineral intake, but contributions to AI and EAR for iron, zinc and calcium were very low (5-20%, 10-60% and 10-70%, respectively). This deficiency could be associated with growth problems or diseases in adulthood, and fortification of commercial products is recommended.

Effects of foliar application of salicylic acid and nitric oxide in alleviating iron deficiency induced chlorosis of Arachis hypogaea L.
Kong J1, Dong Y2, Xu L1, Liu S1, Bai X1.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:

The aim of this experiment was to analyze the alleviation mechanism of exogenous salicylic acid (SA) and sodium nitroprusside (SNP, a nitric oxide donor) on peanut seedlings under Fe deficiency. The effects of SA and SNP on iron uptake and availability, ions balance and oxidant damage were studied with foliar application of exogenous 1.0 mM SA (SA) or 2.5 mM SNP (SNP) or 0.5 mM SA+1.25 mM SNP [1/2(SA+SNP)] or 1.0 mM SA+2.5 mM SNP (SA+SNP).
RESULTS:

The results showed that after 21 days treatment, the peanut seedlings growing under iron deficiency conditions exhibited leaf interveinal chlorosis, and this iron-deficiency induced symptom was prevented by foliar application of SA, SNP, 1/2 (SA+SNP), especially SA+SNP. The increased contents of chlorophyll and active iron, and increased Fe accumulation in cell organelles were observed in SA+SNP treated young leaves, suggesting that an improvement of iron availability in plants. Moreover, the improved nutrient solution pH, increased H+-ATPase activity and increased iron concentration in roots in SA+SNP treated plants, suggesting that SA+SNP is effective in modulating iron uptake. Furthermore, the increased calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) and zinc (Zn) concentrations and decreased manganese (Mn) and copper (Cu) concentrations in the leaves and roots of peanut indicated that SA+SNP stimulated the maintenance of ions disturbed by Fe deficiency. In addition, SA+SNP alleviated the increased accumulation of superoxide anion (O2•-) generation rate and malondialdehyde (MDA), and modulated the antioxidant enzymes.
CONCLUSIONS:

These results indicated that the interaction of SA and SNP promoted Fe uptake, translocation and activation; modulated the balance of mineral elements; and protected Fe deficiency induced oxidative stress. Therefore, SA and SNP had synergistic effects in alleviating chlorosis induced by Fe deficiency.

Abstractin English, Spanish

High output stoma is a frequent complication in patients with ileostomies that is not well identified and is not often properly addressed by clinicians. It has not been described properly, and can vary between debits of 2.000ml in 24 h to 1.500 ml in 3-5 days, according to different authors. Frequently presents both short-term and long-term negative implications for patients and is associated with readmissions. We present a review of published literature focusing in surgical resection-related factors that influence a later appearance of this complication, causes involved in its development, the need to establish a clear and objective concept of high ouput as well as the negative implications it presents. Also we develop how should we the management of these patients regarding treatment and nutritional approach.

Accidental intrathecal injection of magnesium sulfate for cesarean section.
Gilani MT1, Zirak N1, Razavi M2.
Author information
Abstract

Magnesium sulfate is used frequently in the operation room and risks of wrong injection should be considered. A woman with history of pseudocholinesterase enzyme deficiency in the previous surgery was referred for cesarean operation. Magnesium sulfate of 700 mg (3.5 ml of 20% solution) was accidentally administered in the subarachnoid space. First, the patient had warm sensation and cutaneous anesthesia, but due to deep tissue pain, general anesthesia was induced by thiopental and atracurium. After the surgery, muscle relaxation and lethargy remained. At 8-10 h later, muscle strength improved and train of four (TOF) reached over 0.85, and then the endotracheal tube was removed. The patient was evaluated during the hospital stay and on the anesthesia clinic. No neurological symptoms, headache or backache were reported. Due to availability of magnesium sulfate, we should be careful for inadvertent intravenous, spinal and epidural injection; therefore before injection must be double checked.

Appropriate physical activity and dietary intake achieve optimal metabolic control in older type 2 diabetes patients.
Huang JH1, Cheng FC2, Tsai LC3, Lee NY4, Lu YF1.
Author information
Abstract
AIMS/INTRODUCTION:

The aim of the present study was to investigate an appropriate level of physical activity and optimal dietary intake in older type 2 diabetes patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:

The cross-sectional study enrolled 210 older type 2 diabetes patients. Participants were interviewed to obtain information on physical activity, 24-h dietary recall and typical weekly dietary patterns. Anthropometric measurements, and biochemical analysis of blood and urine were determined.
RESULTS:

Moderate physical activity (either moderate leisure-time physical activity or moderate physical activity level) and diet with protein intake of ≥0.8 g/kg/day were associated with lower glycated hemoglobin and triglyceride, higher high-density lipoprotein, lower waist circumference, body mass index and body fat, as well as better serum magnesium and albumin levels in older diabetic patients. In contrast, inadequate protein intake was correlated with higher glycated hemoglobin, triglyceride, body fat percentage, waist circumference and body mass index. In addition, high physical activity with inadequate protein and magnesium intake might exacerbate magnesium deficiency, resulting in poor glycemic control in older diabetic patients. Furthermore, low physical activity and inadequate protein intake were linked with poor glycemic control, and lower high-density lipoprotein, and higher triglyceride, body fat percentage, waist circumference and body mass index.
CONCLUSIONS:

Moderate physical activity and adequate dietary protein intake (≥0.8 g/kg/day) might be the optimal recommendation for better metabolic control in older adults with type 2 diabetes.

Haplotype analysis of CLDN19 single nucleotide polymorphisms in Spanish patients with familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis.
Martin-Nuñez E1, Cordoba-Lanus E, Gonzalez-Acosta H, Oliet A, Izquierdo E, Claverie-Martin F.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC) is an autosomal recessive tubular disease caused by mutations in the CLDN16 or CLDN19 gene. Previous studies using microsatellite markers flanking the CLDN19 locus estimated that p.G20D (c.59G>A), a recurrent mutation in Spanish families, is a founder mutation. In the present study, we assessed the haplotype of Spanish patients using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).
METHODS:

Twenty-seven FHHNC patients were included in this study. We analyzed four SNPs located in CLDN19 introns 3 and 4 by polymerase chain reaction amplification and DNA sequencing.
RESULTS:

Three new patients with homozygous p.G20D were identified. The SNP genotyping analysis showed that alleles carrying this mutation shared a common SNP haplotype.
CONCLUSIONS:

Our findings suggest the existence of a founder effect responsible for FHHNC in our cohort. Testing for the presence of mutation p.G20D should be the first genetic screening in Spanish patients.

Oral magnesium supplementation in type II diabetic patients.
Solati M1, Ouspid E2, Hosseini S3, Soltani N4, Keshavarz M5, Dehghani M6.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:

Magnesium is the second most abundant intracellular cation. It plays an important role in insulin homeostasis and glucose metabolism through multiple enzymatic reactions. With increasing data on magnesium deficiency in diabetic patients and epidemiological studies demonstrating magnesium deficiency as a risk factor for diabetes, it is logical to search for its possible beneficial effects on diabetes control and prevention. We aimed to determine whether oral magnesium supplementation improves metabolic control, lipid profile and blood pressure in patients with type II diabetes.
METHODS:

Fifty four patients with type II diabetes were included in a randomized double blind placebocontrolled clinical trial.Patients received either placebo or 300 mg elemental magnesium (as magnesium sulfate -MgSo4-) daily, for 3 months. Metabolic control, lipid profile, blood pressure, magnesium status, hepatic enzymes, hemoglobin concentration, and anthropometric indices were determined in the beginning and at the end of the study.
RESULTS:

Daily administration of 300 mg elemental magnesium for 3 months, significantly improved fasting blood glucose (183.9±15.43 to 125.8±6.52 vs. 196.5±28.12 to 136.5±7.94, p< 0.0001), 2-hour post prandial glucose (239.1±74.75 to 189.1±60mg/dl vs. 246.4±97.37 to 247.8±86.74mg/dl, p< 0.01), lipid profile, blood pressure and hepatic enzymes.
CONCLUSION:

Oral magnesium supplementation with proper dosage has beneficial effects on blood glucose, lipid profile, and blood pressure in patients with type II diabetes.

Abstract
OBJECTIVE:

To determine the frequency and factors associated with hypomagnesaemia in hypokalemic type-2 diabetic patients presenting at Civil Hospital, Karachi.
STUDY DESIGN:

A cross-sectional study.
PLACE AND DURATION OF STUDY:

Department of Medicine and Diabetic Clinic of Civil Hospital and Dow Medical College, Karachi, from November 2010 to May 2011.
METHODOLOGY:

A total of 358 adult type-2 diabetics with hypokalemia were selected for this study. With aseptic measures, venous blood was collected for serum magnesium, potassium, HDLc, LDLc Triglyceride (TGs) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) from each subject after an overnight fasting and was analyzed on Roche Hitachi 820 Photo Spectrometry. The data was analyzed on SPSS version 17 to determine the factors associated with hypomagnesaemia like duration of diabetes, Body Mass Index (BMI), diabetic nephropathy, HDLc, LDLc Triglyceride (TGs) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level.
RESULTS:

Mean age of study population was 55.62 ± 9.9 years. Most of them (n=228, 63.7%) were males. Out of the 358 subjects, 198 (55.3%) had hypomagnesaemia. There was significant association between hypomagnesaemia with duration of diabetes, Body Mass Index (BMI), diabetic nephropathy, HDLc, LDLc Triglyceride (TGs) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level.
CONCLUSION:

Hypomagnesaemia is very common in type-2 diabetic hypokalemic patients. Therefore, it should be routinely sought by the clinicians. Early recognition and subsequent treatment of hypomagnesaemia may help in better glycemic control, may delay the chronic complications and decrease the mortality in diabetic hypokalemic patients.

Abstract

Ballet dancing is a multifaceted activity requiring muscular power, strength, endurance, flexibility, and agility; necessitating demanding training schedules. Furthermore dancers may be under aesthetic pressure to maintain a lean physique, and adolescent dancers require extra nutrients for growth and development. This cross-sectional study investigated the nutritional status of 47 female adolescent ballet dancers (13-18 years) living in Auckland, New Zealand. Participants who danced at least 1 hr per day 5 days per week completed a 4-day estimated food record, anthropometric measurements (Dual-energy X-ray Absorptiometry) and hematological analysis (iron and vitamin D). Mean BMI was 19.7 ± 2.4 kg/m2 and percentage body fat, 23.5 ± 4.1%. The majority (89.4%) of dancers had a healthy weight (5th-85th percentile) using BMI-for-age growth charts. Food records showed a mean energy intake of 8097.3 ± 2155.6 kJ/day (48.9% carbohydrate, 16.9% protein, 33.8% fat, 14.0% saturated fat). Mean carbohydrate and protein intakes were 4.8 ± 1.4 and 1.6 ± 0.5 g/kg/day respectively. Over half (54.8%) of dancers consumed less than 5 g carbohydrate/kg/day, and 10 (23.8%) less than 1.2 g protein/kg/day. Over 60% consumed less than the estimated average requirement for calcium, folate, magnesium and selenium. Thirteen (28.3%) dancers had suboptimal iron status (serum ferritin (SF) < 20 μg/L). Of these, four had iron deficiency (SF < 12 μg/L, hemoglobin (Hb) ≥ 120 g/L) and one iron deficiency anemia (SF < 12 μg/L, Hb < 120 g/L). Mean serum 25-hydroxy vitamin D was 75.1 ± 18.6 nmol/L, 41 (91.1%) had concentrations above 50 nmol/L. Female adolescent ballet dancers are at risk for iron deficiency, and possibly inadequate nutrient intakes.

Abstract
OBJECTIVE:

Adequate Zn and Mg intakes may be beneficial for the prevention and treatment of mental health problems, such as depression, anxiety and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder. We aimed to investigate the prospective association between dietary intakes of Zn and Mg and internalising and externalising behaviour problems in a population-based cohort of adolescents.
DESIGN:

Prospective analysis (general linear mixed models) of dietary intakes of Zn and Mg assessed using a validated FFQ and mental health symptoms assessed using the Youth Self-Report (YSR), adjusting for sex, physical activity, family income, supplement status, dietary misreporting, BMI, family functioning and energy intake.
SETTING:

Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study.
SUBJECTS:

Adolescents (n 684) at the 14- and 17-year follow-ups.
RESULTS:

Higher dietary intake of Mg (per SD increase) was significantly associated with reduced externalising behaviours (β = -1.45; 95% CI -2.40, -0.50; P = 0.003). There was a trend towards reduced externalising behaviours with higher Zn intake (per SD increase; β = -0.73; 95% CI -1.57, 0.10; P = 0.085).
CONCLUSIONS:

The study shows an association between higher dietary Mg intake and reduced externalising behaviour problems in adolescents. We observed a similar trend, although not statistically significant, for Zn intake. Randomised controlled trials are necessary to determine any benefit of micronutrient supplementation in the prevention and treatment of mental health problems in adolescents.

Abstract
CONTEXT:

It is evident that about 30-50% of patients with Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) do not manifest develop secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT). A number of theories have been proposed to explain this lack of SHPT, including hypomagnesemia.
SETTINGS AND DESIGN:

Retrospective review of laboratory database.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:

We evaluated the differences in serum magnesium (Mg) levels among those with VDD with or without SHPT. A retrospective review of 6255 laboratory data of bone mineral profiles performed in the period of 2007-2013. After excluding patients with hypercalcemia, renal dysfunction/unknown kidney function and primary hypothyroidism, the remaining 1323 patient data were analyzed. SHPT was defined as serum parathyroid hormone >65 in those with VDD.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS USED:

ANOVA and Wilcoxon tests as appropriate to compare means. Multivariate logistic regression to analyze relation between variables and outcome of SHPT.
RESULTS:

We noted that 55% patients (n = 727) had VDD, and among those who had VDD, 23% (n = 170) were hypocalcemic (corrected serum calcium <8.5). Patients with VDD who did not exhibit SHPT were 56% (n = 407). The mean (±standard deviation) serum Mg levels in the entire cohort (n = 1323) was 1.94 ± 0.26 mg/dl and 1.95 ± 0.26 mg/dl in VDD cohort and 2 ± 0.31 mg/dl in the VDD-hypocalcemic cohort. There was no statistical difference in the Mg levels among those with SHPT compared to those without SHPT (P = 0.14). Serum calcium and phosphorus were lower in those with SHPT (P = 0.06 and P < 0.001, respectively). In multivariate logistic regression, serum calcium (P = 0.043), phosphorus (P < 0.001) and severe VDD (P < 0.001) independently correlated with occurrence of SHPT in VDD.
CONCLUSIONS:

Serum Mg levels did not explain the functional hypoparathyroidism seen in about half of the patients with VDD. A low normal serum calcium and phosphorus levels are more likely to be associated with VDD patients who develop SHPT.

Abstract
BACKGROUND:

It has been reported that ferritin and iron deficiency may be related to the path physiology of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).
AIM:

The aim of this study was to determine the association between iron deficiency and ADHD and the impact and role of iron deficiency on the development of ADHD in children.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS:

The study based on the case-control study age- and sex-matched control and conducted at the School Health and Primary Healthcare Clinics, Qatar. A total of 630 children with ADHD aged 5-18 and 630 controls aged 5-18 years old. Sociodemographic and clinical data were collected, including physician diagnosis. The health status of the subjects was assessed by ascertaining clinical presentations and symptoms, family history, body mass index (BMI), iron deficiency, ferritin, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus levels. Descriptive, univariate, and multivariate statistical analysis were performed.
RESULTS:

Mean age (standard deviation [SD] in years) for ADHD and control children were 11.54 (3.83) versus 11.50 (3.62). There were statistically significant differences between ADHD versus control children for vitamin D [16.81 (7.84) vs. 22.18 (9.00) ng/ml], serum iron [82.11 (13.61) vs. 85.60 (12.47) ng/ml], ferritin [36.26 (5.93) vs. 38.19 (5.61) ng/ml], hemoglobin [12.02 (2.13) vs. 12.89 (2.02) g/dL], magnesium [0.82 (0.08) vs. 0.88 (0.06) mmol/L], serum calcium level [2.35 (0.12) vs. 2.39 (0.14) mmol/L], and phosphorous [1.47 (0.30) vs. 1.54 (0.26) mmol/L]. Of total 630 of ADHD children, 116 (18.4%) had severe vitamin D deficiency (<10 ng/ml). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that serum vitamin D level, serum iron, ferritin, serum calcium level, physical activity, nervous behavior, consanguinity, BMI, and child order were considered as the main factors associated with the ADHD after adjusting for age, gender, and other variables.
CONCLUSION:

The study indicates that low serum iron, ferritin levels, and vitamin D deficiency may be associated with ADHD.

[Article in Russian]
Petrov VI, Shishimorov IN, Perminov AA, Nefedov IV.
Abstract

We have performed 24-week open-labeled comparative randomized parallel-group study of the basic therapy efficacy of uncontrolled and partly controlled atopic asthma children with magnesium deficiency. The additional correction of magnesium deficiency increases the efficacy of atopic asthma basic therapy. It leads to more pronounced inhibition of local allergic inflammation in respiratory system, decreases the exacerbation frequency (9.5%, p = 0.02), and increases the number of asymptomatic days and the 12-week constant asthma control frequency (71.4%, p = 0.145) as compared to the group without magnesium deficiency correction.

Abstract

Static magnetic fields (SMFs) can enhance the ability of bone formation by osteoblast and is a potential physical therapy to bone disorders and the maintenance of bone health. But, the mechanism is not clear yet. Certain mineral elements including macro and trace elements are essential for normal bone metabolism. Deficiency of these elements can cause severe bone disorders including osteoporosis. However, there are few reports regarding the role of mineral elements in the regulation of bone formation under SMFs. In this study, hypomagnetic field (HyMF) of 500 nT, moderate SMF (MMF) of 0.2 T, and high SMF (HiMF) of 16 T were used to investigate the effects of SMFs on mineral element (calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, manganese, and zinc) alteration of MC3T3-E1 cells during osteoblast mineralization. The results showed that osteoblasts in differentiation accumulated more mineral elements than non-differentiated cell cultures. Furthermore, HyMF reduced osteoblast differentiation but did not affect mineral elements levels compared with control of geomagnetic field. MMF decreased osteoblast differentiation with elevated iron content. HiMF enhanced osteoblast differentiation and increased all the mineral contents except copper. It is suggested that the altered potential of osteoblast differentiation under SMFs may partially due to the involvement of different mineral elements.

Abstract

Diabetic patients frequently develop a constellation of electrolyte disorders. These disturbances are particularly common in decompensated diabetics, especially in the context of diabetic ketoacidosis or nonketotic hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome. These patients are markedly potassium-, magnesium- and phosphate-depleted. Diabetes mellitus (DM) is linked to both hypo- and hyper-natremia reflecting the coexistence of hyperglycemia-related mechanisms, which tend to change serum sodium to opposite directions. The most important causal factor of chronic hyperkalemia in diabetic individuals is the syndrome of hyporeninemic hypoaldosteronism. Impaired renal function, potassium-sparing drugs, hypertonicity and insulin deficiency are also involved in the development of hyperkalemia. This article provides an overview of the electrolyte disturbances occurring in DM and describes the underlying mechanisms. This insight should pave the way for pathophysiology-directed therapy, thus contributing to the avoidance of the several deleterious effects associated with electrolyte disorders and their treatment.
