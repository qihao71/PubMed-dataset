Excerpt

Objective The objective of this systematic review was to assess the scientific basis for methods that might provide earlier cancer diagnosis in persons with symptoms or signs that might indicate cancer. Screening for cancer was not included in this assessment. Conclusions: Adding a photograph of suspected skin cancer to the standard referral can shorten the time to the initial evaluation by a specialist department. The management of the patient can also be better planned and resources can be saved. Providing information and education to the population can improve knowledge and awareness of cancer, especially if the intervention is personalised and this can be seen up to 2 years after the intervention. Studies with longer follow-up times are lacking. We could not determine if providing information and education to health care professionals led to that patients are diagnosed earlier cancer diagnosis or that such interventions had any impact on survival or mortality. The scientific basis was insufficient in this respect. Fast-tracks for managing persons with certain defined symptoms that are indicative of cancer can shorten the diagnostic phase by a number of weeks. However, most new cases are discovered as part of routine patient care outside the fast-tracks. There are some indications that the diagnostic time of those in routine care is actually increased when fast-tracks are introduced into the health care system. The risk for such delay for patients in routine care must be addressed when fast-tracks are introduced and evaluated. Self-examinations of breasts do not affect breast cancer mortality on a population level but do increase the rate of local diagnostic procedures. Cost-effectiveness could not be evaluated for any of the methods because of a lack of information in the literature.

Abstract

Colon cancer is the most common type of cancer and major cause of death worldwide. The detection of colon cancer is difficult in early stages. However, the secretory proteins have been used as ideal biomarker for the detection of colon cancer progress in cancer patients. Serum/tissue protein expression could help general practitioners to identify colon cancer at earlier stages. By this way, we use the biomarkers to evaluate the anticancer drugs and their response to therapy in cancer models. Recently, the biomarker discovery is important in cancer biology and disease management. Also, many measurable specific molecular components have been studied in colon cancer therapeutics. The biomolecules are mainly DNA, RNA, metabolites, enzymes, mRNA, aptamers and proteins. Thus, in this review we demonstrate the important protein biomarker in colon cancer development and molecular identification of protein biomarker discovery.

Abstract

In humans, purine de novo synthesis pathway consists of multi-functional enzymes. Nucleotide metabolism enzymes are potential drug targets for treating cancer and autoimmune diseases. Glycinamide ribonucleotide transformylase (GART) is one of the most important trifunctional enzymes involved in purine synthesis. Previous studies have demonstrated the role of folate inhibitors against tumor activity. In this present study, three components of GART enzyme were targeted as receptor dataset and in silico analysis was carried out with folate ligand dataset. To accomplish the task, Autodock 4.2 was used for determining the docking compatibilities of ligand and receptor dataset. Taken together, it has been suggested that folate ligands could be potentially used as inhibitors of GART.

Learning from adverse outcomes: guidelines on colonoscopic polypectomy in patients aged 85 years and older.
Baker G1, Valori R1, Brooklyn T1.
Author information
Abstract

A patient between 80 and 90 years of age died following a polypectomy as part of a colonoscopy surveillance programme for previous polyps. As a consequence of this adverse event, we have amended our local guidelines. While perforation is a recognised complication of polypectomy, it was felt that the decision taken to remove the polyp was incorrect. The decision to remove a polyp should be at the endoscopist's clinical discretion and should depend on polyp size, the patient's age and comorbidities and their performance status. We recommend that polyps <20 mm in size should be regarded as low-risk polyps and that polypectomy of low-risk polyps are not essential in patients aged 85 years and older. Polypectomy of high-risk polyps in patients aged 85 years and older should only be undertaken by experienced endoscopists and with appropriate discussion with the patient prior to the procedure. Patients aged >80 years should be dissuaded from having further colonoscopic surveillance and should not be included in polyp detection rate reports to ensure that polypectomy decisions are not influenced by performance monitoring. We recommend other endoscopy units review their local practice and consider introducing these (or similar) guidelines to reduce risk to older patients. We also recommend that the British Society of Gastroenterology should include more specific guidance on surveillance and polypectomy in the older patient when the guidance is next reviewed.

Excerpt

The aim of the present report was to assess the added benefit of sipuleucel-T versus the appropriate comparator therapy (ACT) for treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic (non-visceral) castrate-resistant prostate cancer in male adults in whom chemotherapy is not yet clinically indicated. The Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) specified the following treatments as possible ACTs:watchful waiting while maintaining ongoing conventional androgen deprivation therapy (ADT); or, if applicable,combined maximal androgen blockade with a non-steroidal anti-androgen (flutamide, bicalutamide); or: abiraterone acetate while maintaining ongoing ADT. The company concurred with the G-BA’s specification and chose watchful waiting while maintaining ongoing conventional ADT as comparator therapy. The present benefit assessment was conducted in comparison with the G-BA’s ACT. The assessment was conducted based on patient-relevant outcomes and on randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Excerpt

The aim of the present report was to assess the added benefit of eribulin for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have progressed after at least one chemotherapeutic regimen for advanced disease. Prior therapies should have included an anthracycline and a taxane in either the adjuvant or metastatic setting unless patients were not suitable for these treatments. The assessment was conducted separately for 3 research questions versus the appropriate comparator therapy (ACT) specified by the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA). The benefit assessment of eribulin in the 3 research questions was conducted versus the ACTs specified by the G-BA. This concurs with the company’s approach. For research questions A and B, the company – like the G-BA – assumed that, for patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2 / neu)-positive breast cancer, the treatment option of an anti-HER2 / neu treatment was carefully considered and assessed as not indicated before the decision for treatment with eribulin. Since the company assumed that, for patients with HER2 / neu-positive breast cancer, the treatment option of an anti-HER2 / neu treatment was carefully considered and assessed as not indicated before the decision for treatment with eribulin, it conducted no detailed analysis of the data of these patients (research question C). This population of patients was considered as a separate subpopulation in the present benefit assessment. The assessment was conducted based on patient-relevant outcomes and on randomized controlled trials (RCTs).

Excerpt

On 14 February 2014 the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) commissioned the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) to conduct a supplementary assessment for Commission A13-37 (benefit assessment of regorafenib). In the commenting procedure on the assessment of regorafenib, the pharmaceutical company (hereinafter abbreviated to “the company”) submitted further data to the G-BA that went beyond the information in the dossier. These were data on the CORRECT study on the comparison of regorafenib + best supportive care (BSC) versus placebo + BSC. This study was already contained in the company’s dossier and was included as relevant in the dossier assessment A13-37. However, the data presented in the dossier were not evaluable for the outcome on health-related quality of life because only analyses were available in which the proportion of patients who were not considered in the analysis were over 30% and missing values were not imputed. With the comments and after the oral hearing, the company subsequently submitted new analyses, which, from the company’s point of view, allow to assess health-related quality of life. For the assessment of side effects, adverse events (AEs), which were recorded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) of the grades 3, 4 and 5, were included as so-called “severe AEs” in the dossier assessment A13-37, among other factors. However, AEs of CTCAE grade 1 and 2 were not included in the assessment. The company did not consider this to be justified. Hence it claimed the inclusion of CTCAE grade 1 and 2 AEs into the benefit assessment. After the oral hearing, the G-BA commissioned IQWiG to assess the analyses on health-related quality of life for the CORRECT study subsequently provided. Furthermore, the G-BA commissioned IQWiG to submit a comment on the objections put forward by the company on the exclusion of the results on CTCAE grade 1 and 2 AEs. In the following Chapter 2, the additional analyses on health-related quality of life and the objections put forward by the company on the exclusion of the results on CTCAE grade 1 and 2 AEs are assessed according to the commission. The responsibility for the present assessment and the results of the assessment lies exclusively with IQWiG. The assessment is forwarded to the G-BA. The G-BA decides on the added benefit.

Excerpt

On 23 January 2014 the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) commissioned the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) to conduct a supplementary assessment for commission A13-33 (benefit assessment of enzalutamide). In the commenting procedure on the assessment of enzalutamide, on 19 December 2013, the pharmaceutical company (hereinafter abbreviated to “the company”) submitted further data to the G-BA that went beyond the information in the dossier. These were data on the AFFIRM study on the comparison of enzalutamide + best supportive care (BSC) versus BSC. This study was already contained in the company’s dossier and was included as relevant in the dossier assessment A13-33. For the outcomes on adverse events (AEs), however, the data presented in the dossier were either not evaluable or could only be interpreted in qualitative terms. With the comments, the company subsequently submitted new analyses, which, from the company’s point of view, allow to assess the AEs. Moreover, it was unclear in the assessment on the basis of the information presented in the dossier whether the administration of analgesics in the first 13 weeks of the AFFIRM study was optimized for the individual patient in the sense of the appropriate comparator therapy (ACT) BSC. In the comment, the company submitted additional data on the treatment with analgesics in the first 13 weeks of the AFFIRM study, which, from the point of view of the company, prove that the ACT was adequately implemented. The G-BA commissioned IQWiG with the assessment of these analyses subsequently submitted for the AFFIRM study in the commenting procedure. In the following Chapter 2 the additional analyses for the AFFIRM study are assessed according to the commission. The extent and probability of added benefit of enzalutamide are then described under consideration of the analyses subsequently submitted. The responsibility for the present assessment and the results of the assessment lies exclusively with IQWiG. The assessment is forwarded to the G-BA. The G-BA decides on the added benefit.

Author information
Abstract

Oral cavity carcinoma is the most common cancer in Indian population. Metastatic nodal disease is the most important prognostic factor for oral cancers. In head and neck cancers with clinically N0 neck, standard selective neck dissection is performed by protecting the spinal accessory nerve to remove level IIA & IIB lymph nodes. The purpose of this study was to analyze the significance of level IIB dissection in patients of oral cavity cancer who underwent primary surgery with functional neck dissection. Two hundred ten patients with clinically N0 neck underwent neck dissection, where level IIB lymph nodes were dissected, labelled and processed separately. Among 210 patients of clinically N0 neck, 168 patients were pathologically N0 (80 %). Out of remaining 42 (20 %), 36 (17.14 %) were pN1 and 6 (2.86 %) were pN2. Among those with pN1 (36), level IB was involved in 24 patients (66.67 %) and level IIA was involved in 12 patients (33.33 %). Only 2 patients had involvement of level IIB lymph nodes. Among 6 patients of pN2 disease, 4 patients had simultaneous involvement of level IB and level IIA lymph nodes. Remaining 2 patients had isolated involvement of level III lymph nodes. Thus only 2 patients (< 1 %) out of 210 clinically N0 oral squamous cell carcinoma showed level IIB lymph node involvement. Thus we conclude that a frozen section of level 2a is advisable to decide the need for level 2b node dissection in clinically N0 neck as the sensitivity of clinical evaluation is extremely low.

Paratracheal cyst rupture: a differential diagnosis for tracheal rupture.
Marques J1, Henriques AR2, Azevedo L2, Chalo D2, Almeida A2.
Author information
Abstract

Tracheobronchial rupture is a rare but potentially life-threatening complication commonly caused by neck and chest trauma. Iatrogenic tracheobronchial rupture can be caused by intubation, tracheostomy, bronchoscopy but also linked to pre-existing primary diseases. Paratracheal air cysts, infrequently described in literature, seem to be associated with obstructive lung disease and weaknesses in right posterior lateral wall of the trachea. We report a case of a paratracheal air cyst rupture in a previous healthy patient.

Shining Pearls Sign: A New Identity for Venous Malformations on Computed Tomographic Imaging.
Bhat V1, Bhat V2.
Author information
Abstract

Vascular malformations, in particular venous malformations (VM), are common lesions involving the pediatric and adolescent population. VM occur at approximately 1:5,000 to 10,000; approximately 40% of them occur in the head and neck regions. Classical appearance of VM on imaging is a demonstration of near-normal-sized or mildly dilated feeding arteries which subsequently lead to dilated venous structures of varying caliber, thus constituting the malformation. Phleboliths are the hallmark of VM. Plain radiography has been an established modality for demonstrating phleboliths. The emergence of computed tomographic (CT) as a preferred imaging modality for the evaluation of a complex vascular malformation necessitates familiarity with the spectrum of CT appearances of this lesion. This presentation illustrates an additional CT sign, "shining pearls sign," highlighting the striking display of phleboliths in the vascular malformations, prompting correct diagnosis.

Maintenance of balance between airway pressure and intracranial pressure in a patient with tracheal stenosis undergoing craniotomy: a case report.
Güçlü ÇY1, Meço BC2, Karamustafa M2, Keçik Y2.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:

Tracheal stenosis is a rare but a life-threatening condition and anesthesia of a patient with tracheal stenosis is challenging for anesthesiologists. Maintaining stable hemodynamics and ventilation parameters are important issues in neuroanesthesia. Any increase in airway peak pressure and ETCO2 will result in increase in intracranial pressure which must be avoided during craniotomies. Tracheal stenosis could be a reason for increased airway pressure.
CASE REPORT:

We described a patient undergoing craniotomy with tracheal stenosis.
CONCLUSION:

Detailed preparation for intubation, to stabilize airway dynamics and to make the right decision for the surgery were important points. To maintain of a good balance between cerebral dynamics and airway dynamics were the pearls of this case.

Excerpt

The aim of the project reported here was to investigate whether publications of RCTs on patients with advanced cancer take into account aspects of the end of life, the corresponding terminology and the relevance of palliative care needs of these patients. Based on the publications of treatment studies, the specific aims were to investigate if: the phase of the disease (progressive terminal disease) was specified correctly (subgoal 1); the superior patient-relevant treatment goal (prolongation of life expectancy, improvement of quality of life/best possible maintenance of quality of life or symptom control) was specifically named (the superior treatment goal must not be confused with the study outcomes, but describes the overall goal for the patient that the intervention is clinically intended or hoped to achieve, subgoal 2); patient-relevant outcomes (outcomes on overall survival and/or patient-reported outcomes [PROs]) were assessed under particular consideration of the superior treatment goals identified in subgoal 2 (subgoal 3); terms such as curation, palliation, palliative medicine/palliative care, best supportive care, supportive therapy and palliative therapy were used and how they were defined (subgoal 4); a critical reflection of the benefit-harm profile was conducted (subgoal 5).

The aim of this report is to assess the added benefit of radium-223 dichloride (hereinafter referred to as “radium-223”) in comparison with the appropriate comparator therapy (ACT) in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer, symptomatic bone metastases and no known visceral metastases. The Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) specified an ACT for each different patient group:for patients with the primary treatment goal of prolongation of life: docetaxel in combination with prednisone or prednisolone; for patients with the primary treatment goal of symptom control and prevention of late complications and for patients for whom docetaxel treatment is not an option: best supportive care (BSC) (particularly adequate pain therapy, treatment with bisphosphonates and/or radionuclides). In this benefit assessment, the group of patients with the primary treatment goal of symptom control and prevention of late complications and the group of patients for whom docetaxel treatment is not an option were primarily considered jointly, also because of the identical ACT, and are hereinafter referred to as “BSC population”. The group of patients with the primary treatment goal of prolongation of life is hereinafter referred to as “docetaxel population”. Studies that investigated a comparison of radium-223 with or without BSC versus BSC could be considered for the benefit assessment of radium-223 compared with the ACT BSC. The assessment was based on patient-relevant outcomes. One direct comparative randomized controlled trial (RCT) was included in the assessment.

The aim of the present report is to assess the added benefit of trastuzumab emtansine in patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive, unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who previously received trastuzumab and a taxane, separately or in combination. Patients should have either received prior treatment for locally advanced or metastatic disease, or developed disease recurrence during or within 6 months of completing adjuvant therapy. The assessment was conducted in comparison with the appropriate comparator therapy (ACT). The company deviated from the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA)’s specification. It used lapatinib + capecitabine as comparator therapy for the total target population. The dossier assessment was conducted with the ACTs specified by the G-BA because the company did not provide sufficient reasons for deviating from the ACTs. The assessment was based on patient-relevant outcomes. One direct comparative randomized controlled trial (RCT) was included in the assessment.

The Duality of Fgl2 - Secreted Immune Checkpoint Regulator Versus Membrane-Associated Procoagulant: Therapeutic Potential and Implications.
Hu J1, Yan J1, Rao G2, Latha K2, Overwijk WW3, Heimberger AB2, Li S1.
Author information
Abstract

Fibrinogen-like protein 2 (Fgl2), a member of the fibrinogen family, can be expressed as a membrane-associated protein with coagulation activity or in a secreted form possessing unique immune suppressive functions. The biological importance of Fgl2 is evident within viral-induced fibrin depositing inflammatory diseases and malignancies and provides a compelling rationale for Fgl2 expression to not only be considered as a disease biomarker but also as a therapeutic target. This article will provide a comprehensive review of the currently known biological properties of Fgl2 and clarifies future scientific directives.

Neurotensin, a Novel Messenger to Cross-Link Inflammation and Tumor Invasion via Epithelial-Mesenchymal Transition Pathway.
Ye Y1, Liu P2, Wang Y1, Li H1, Wei F1, Cheng Y2, Han L2, Yu J1,2,3.
Author information
Abstract

Multiple cytokines and growth factors are critical for the prognosis of cancer which has been regarded as a worldwide health problem. Recently, neuropeptides, soluble factors regulating a series of functions in the central nervous system, have also been demonstrated to stimulate the proliferation and migration of tumor cells. Among these signaling peptides, the role of neurotensin (NTS) on malignancy procession has become a hot topic. The effects of NTS on tumor growth and its antiapoptosis role have already been identified. Subsequently, studies demonstrated the impact of NTS on the migration and invasion, but the molecular mechanisms involved are still unclear at present. Recently, some reports indicated that NTS could induce expression and secretion of interleukin-8 (IL-8) to promote local imflammatory response which might participate in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-related tumor migration. In present review, we highlight the process of tumor EMT induced by NTS through stimulating IL-8 and the significance of NTS/IL-8 pathway in clinical application prospect.

The life and work of the Dumfries surgeon James Hill (1703-1776): his contributions to the management of cancer and of head injury.
Macintyre I1.
Author information
Abstract

James Hill was apprenticed to the formidable Edinburgh surgeon, physician and philosopher George Young from whom he learned the value of careful observation and scepticism in medicine. As a surgeon in Dumfries he was able to take advantage of newly established medical journals to publish case reports. His book Cases in Surgery summarised three aspects of his life's work as a surgeon. In it he provides a classical description of the features and transmission of sibbens (endemic syphilis) and suggests from careful clinical observation that sibbens and venereal syphilis were the same disease. His success with treatment of cancer led him to advocate curative rather than palliative excision, a view that ran counter to accepted contemporary practice. Hill's ability to diagnose cerebral compression caused by bleeding following head injury enabled him to treat this successfully by directed trephine and drainage. His results on the treatment of head injury were the best to be published in their day and an important addition to the increasing understanding of the basis of the management of head injury.

The study was aimed to develop a polymeric nanoparticle formulation of anticancer drug carboplatin using biodegradable polymer polycaprolactone (PCL). The formulation is intended for intranasal administration to treat glioma anticipating improved brain delivery as nasal route possess direct access to brain and nanoparticles have small size to overcome the mucosal and blood-brain barrier.
OBJECTIVE:

Development and evaluation of carboplatin-PCL nanoparticles for brain delivery by nasal route.
METHODOLOGY:

Carboplatin-loaded PCL nanoparticles (CPCs) were prepared by double emulsion-solvent evaporation technique and characterized by particle size, zeta potential, entrapment efficiency, scanning electron microscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. The CPCs were assessed for in vitro release kinetics, ex vivo permeation and in situ nasal perfusion. Cytotoxic potential of CPCs in vitro was evaluated on LN229 human glioblastoma cells.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION:

The optimized formulation of carboplatin-PCL nanoparticle CPC-08 with particle size of 311.6 ± 4.7 nm and zeta potential -16.3 ± 3.7 mV exhibited percentage entrapment efficiency of 27.95 ± 4.21. In vitro drug release showed initial burst release followed by slow and continues release indicating biphasic pattern. The ex vivo permeation pattern through sheep nasal mucosa also exhibited a similar release pattern as for in vitro release studies. In situ nasal perfusion studies in Wistar rats demonstrate that CPCs show better nasal absorption than carboplatin solution. In vitro cytotoxicity studies on LN229 cells showed an enhancement in cytotoxicity by CPCs compared to carboplatin alone.
CONCLUSION:

CPC-08 effectively improves nasal absorption of carboplatin and can be used for intranasal administration of carboplatin for improved brain delivery.

Abstract
OBJECTIVE:

To explore the antitumor effects of low-intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) mediated localized drug delivery of adriamycin-microbubble-PLGA nanoparticle complexes on rabbits VX2 liver tumor.
METHODS:

ADM-NMCs were prepared by covalent linking of ADM-PLGA nanoparticles (ADM-NPs) to the shell of the microbubbles. A fixed water bag filled with microbubbles was subjected to LIFU and non-focused ultrasound respectively, and the ultrasound images of which were recorded before and after ultrasonication. A total of 54 VX2 liver tumor-burdened rabbits were divided into six groups randomly, including control, ADM-NPs combined with LIFU, microbubbles combined with LIFU, ADM-NPs and microbubbles combined with LIFU, ADM-NMCs combined with LIFU and ADM-NMCs combined with Non-FUS. The tumor volume and volume inhibition rate (VIR) of tumor progression were calculated and compared. Apoptotic cells were labeled by terminal deoxyuridine nick end. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen was detected by immunohistochemistry. The median survival time of the animals were recorded and compared.
RESULTS:

ADM-NMCs were successfully prepared with an average diameter of 1721 nm. The highest VIR and apoptotic index (AI) were found in the group of ADM-NMCs combined with LIFU while the lowest proliferating index (PI) was simultaneously observed in this group. The median survival time of the rabbits in the ADM-NMCs combined with LIFU group was the longest (71days) among all groups.
CONCLUSIONS:

ADM-NMCs combined with LIFU could inhibit the rabbits VX2 liver tumor progress by delaying the tumor proliferation and accelerating apoptosis, which presents a novel process for liver tumor targeting chemotherapy.

Epirubicin loading in poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) nanoparticles manifests via altered intracellular localization and cellular response in cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells.
Evangelatov A1, Skrobanska R1, Mladenov N1, Petkova M1, Yordanov G2, Pankov R1.
Author information
Abstract
OBJECTIVE:

Drug loading into nanocarriers is used to facilitate drug delivery to target cells and organs. We have previously reported a change in cellular localization of epirubicin after loading to poly(butyl cyanoacrylate) (PBCA) nanoparticles. We aimed to further investigate the altered cellular localization and cellular responses to the described drug formulation.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:

HeLa cells were treated with epirubicin-loaded PBCA nanoparticles prepared by the pre-polymerization method. A systematic study was performed to evaluate the formulation cytotoxicity. Cellular localization and uptake of the formulation as well as cellular response to the treatment were evaluated.
RESULTS:

Our studies revealed decreased cytotoxicity of the nanoparticle-formulated epirubicin compared to the free drug as well as a noticeable change in the drug's intracellular localization. Epirubicin-loaded nanoparticles were internalized via endocytosis, accumulated inside endosomal vesicles and induced a two-fold stronger pro-apoptotic signal when compared to the free drug. The level of the tumor suppressor protein p53 in HeLa cells increased significantly upon treatment with free epirubicin, but remained relatively unchanged when cells were treated with equivalent dose of nanoparticle-loaded drug, suggesting a possible shift from p53-dependent DNA/RNA intercalation-based induction of cytotoxicity by free epirubicin to a caspase 3-induced cell death by the epirubicin-loaded PBCA formulation.

Esposito F1, Di Serafino M2, Oresta P1.
Author information
Abstractin English, Italian

Malignant sacrococcygeal yolk sac tumor is a rare extra-gonadal germ cell tumor of infancy and childhood. We report the case of a 14-month-old white female infant with a rapidly growing supra-gluteal mass at first misdiagnosed as hemangioma after a clinical assessment. The lesion was then classified as extra-gonadal yolk sac tumor due to alarming ultrasound features, later confirmed at MRI and pathology. This report remarks the need of a rigorous methodology in the ultrasound exploration of the gluteal region.

Subgroup-Based Adaptive (SUBA) Designs for Multi-Arm Biomarker Trials.
Xu Y1, Trippa L2, Müller P3, Ji Y4.
Author information
Abstract

Targeted therapies based on biomarker profiling are becoming a mainstream direction of cancer research and treatment. Depending on the expression of specific prognostic biomarkers, targeted therapies assign different cancer drugs to subgroups of patients even if they are diagnosed with the same type of cancer by traditional means, such as tumor location. For example, Herceptin is only indicated for the subgroup of patients with HER2+ breast cancer, but not other types of breast cancer. However, subgroups like HER2+ breast cancer with effective targeted therapies are rare and most cancer drugs are still being applied to large patient populations that include many patients who might not respond or benefit. Also, the response to targeted agents in humans is usually unpredictable. To address these issues, we propose SUBA, subgroup-based adaptive designs that simultaneously search for prognostic subgroups and allocate patients adaptively to the best subgroup-specific treatments throughout the course of the trial. The main features of SUBA include the continuous reclassification of patient subgroups based on a random partition model and the adaptive allocation of patients to the best treatment arm based on posterior predictive probabilities. We compare the SUBA design with three alternative designs including equal randomization, outcome-adaptive randomization and a design based on a probit regression. In simulation studies we find that SUBA compares favorably against the alternatives.

Bayesian Two-stage Biomarker-based Adaptive Design for Targeted Therapy Development.

Author information
Abstract

We propose a Bayesian two-stage biomarker-based adaptive randomization (AR) design for the development of targeted agents. The design has three main goals: (1) to test the treatment efficacy, (2) to identify prognostic and predictive markers for the targeted agents, and (3) to provide better treatment for patients enrolled in the trial. To treat patients better, both stages are guided by the Bayesian AR based on the individual patient's biomarker profiles. The AR in the first stage is based on a known marker. A Go/No-Go decision can be made in the first stage by testing the overall treatment effects. If a Go decision is made at the end of the first stage, a two-step Bayesian lasso strategy will be implemented to select additional prognostic or predictive biomarkers to refine the AR in the second stage. We use simulations to demonstrate the good operating characteristics of the design, including the control of per-comparison type I and type II errors, high probability in selecting important markers, and treating more patients with more effective treatments. Bayesian adaptive designs allow for continuous learning. The designs are particularly suitable for the development of multiple targeted agents in the quest of personalized medicine. By estimating treatment effects and identifying relevant biomarkers, the information acquired from the interim data can be used to guide the choice of treatment for each individual patient enrolled in the trial in real time to achieve a better outcome. The design is being implemented in the BATTLE-2 trial in lung cancer at the MD Anderson Cancer Center.

Abstract

Omics-based technology platforms have made new kinds of cancer profiling tests feasible. There are several valuable examples in clinical practice, and many more under development. A concerted, transparent process of discovery with lock-down of candidate assays and classifiers and clear specification of intended clinical use is essential. The Institute of Medicine has now proposed a three-stage scheme of confirming and validating analytical findings, validating performance on clinical specimens, and demonstrating explicit clinical utility for an approvable test (Micheel et al., Evolution of translational omics: lessons learned and path forward, 2012).

Smokers' Treatment Expectancies Predict Smoking Cessation Success.
Fucito LM1, Toll BA2, Roos CR1, King AC3.
Author information
Abstract
INTRODUCTION:

Smokers' treatment expectancies may influence their choice of a particular medication as well as their medication experience.
AIMS:

This study examined the role of smokers' treatment expectancies to their smoking cessation outcomes in a completed, randomized, placebo-controlled trial of naltrexone for smoking cessation, controlling for perceptions of treatment assignment.
METHODS:

Treatment seeking cigarette smokers (N = 315) were randomized to receive either naltrexone (50 mg) or placebo in combination with nicotine patch and behavioral counseling. Expectancies for naltrexone as a smoking cessation aid were assessed at baseline and 4 weeks after the quit date.
RESULTS:

More positive baseline medication expectancies predicted higher quit rates at one month in the naltrexone (OR =1.45, p =.04) group but were associated with lower quit rates in the placebo group (OR =.66, p =.03). Maintaining and/or increasing positive medication expectancies in the first month of treatment was associated with better pill adherence during this interval in the naltrexone group (ps <.05). Positive baseline medication expectancies were also associated with the perception of having received naltrexone over placebo among all participants.
CONCLUSIONS:

Positive medication expectancies in smokers may contribute to better treatment response. Assessing treatment expectancies and attempting to maintain or improve them may be important for the delivery, evaluation, and targeting of smoking cessation treatments.

Awake insertion of a Laryngeal Mask Airway-Proseal™ as alternative to awake fiberoptic intubation in management of anticipated difficult airway in ambulatory surgery.
Zaballos M1, Ginel MD2, Portas M2, Barrio M2, López AM3.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES:

The decision whether to manage an ambulatory patient with a previously documented difficult airway with a supraglottic device remain controversial. We report an awake insertion of a Laryngeal Mask Airway Proseal™ in a patient with known difficult airway scheduled for ambulatory surgery.
CASE REPORT:

A 46-yr-old woman was programmed as a day case surgery for breast nodule resection. Her anesthetic record included an impossible intubation with cancelation of surgery and subsequent awake fibroscopic intubation. She reported emotional distress with the previous experience and declined this approach. In view of the previous experience, an awake airway control with a Laryngeal Mask Airway Proseal™ was planned after explaining and reassuring the patient. After adequate topicalisation, a size 4 Laryngeal Mask Airway Proseal™ was successfully inserted after two attempts, and their patency was confirmed by capnography. Anesthesia was induced intravenously and the surgery was uneventful.
CONCLUSION:

We describe a feasible alternative strategy to awake intubation in a patient with known difficult airway undergoing ambulatory surgery. In this specific clinical situation, if tracheal intubation is deemed unnecessary, awake supraglottic airway might allow adequate ventilation and their use should be considered.

Incidental biliary cystadenoma mimicking liver metastasis in a gastric cancer patient.
Yazıcı P1, Aydın Ü2.
Author information
Abstract

Biliary cystadenoma represents a rare benign cystic hepatic neoplasm with premalignant potential. The diagnosis is usually difficult, and imaging methods may not be possible to clarify the pathology. It can be hard to determine, particularly in patients with a previous cancer history that has high metastatic potential in the liver. We presented a 53-year-old man with a newly diagnosed liver mass that was suspicious for metastasis 2 years after gastric cancer surgery and histological analysis confirmed the diagnosis of biliary cystadenoma.

Abstract
BACKGROUND/AIM:

We investigated the symptoms and needs of terminal cancer patients in a region where formal palliative care is limited. Here we present the demographic features and symptoms of end-stage cancer patients living in a city in northern Turkey.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:

The study was conducted at Gaziosmanpaşa University (Tokat, Turkey), in 2011 and 2012. End-stage cancer patients admitted or referred by various departments to our outpatient pain unit were included. Demographic data, treatment histories, primary tumor sites, patient complaints, and symptom intensities measured using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System Scale were prospectively entered into a database.
RESULTS:

A total of 107 patients (36 female and 71 male) were included. Gastrointestinal cancer was the most common form of cancer (43%), followed by genitourinary (25.3%) and lung cancer (15%). The most common symptom was fatigue (98.1%). The other symptoms (in decreasing order) were pain (92.5%), insomnia (92.5%), loss of appetite (76.6%), constipation (71%), dyspnea (63.6%), nausea (60.7%), cough (57.9%), and vomiting (48.6%). Eighty-six percent of the patients (n = 92) had metastases. Most lived in the city (59.8%) and 84 (78.5%) lived with their spouses.
CONCLUSION:

Patients were referred at the late stages of disease with pain as the principal presenting symptom. Family members were the principal caregivers.

Criteria for designation of clinical substage in canine lymphoma: a survey of veterinary oncologists.
Barber LG1, Weishaar KM1.
Author information
Abstract

Clinical substage is frequently reported to be prognostic in dogs with lymphoma, yet formal criteria for defining this parameter are lacking. The World Health Organization TNM Classification of Tumors of Domestic Animals simply defines substage as the absence or presence of systemic signs (substages a and b, respectively). We designed a survey to query veterinary oncologists on the criteria they use to determine clinical substage in practice. Gastrointestinal, constitutional and respiratory signs were the most commonly identified clinical factors, with greater than 90% respondents indicating that inappetence, vomiting, diarrhoea, changes in attitude, weakness and dyspnea were integral in assigning clinical substage. Nevertheless, more than three-quarters of respondents also considered metabolic, neurologic and nutritional parameters when making this determination. For most factors, respondents reported mild-to-moderate severity of clinical signs was sufficient for substage b designation.

Excerpt

Treatment switching can occur when patients in the control group of a clinical trial are allowed to switch onto the experimental treatment at some point during follow-up. Switching is common in clinical trials of cancer treatments and can also occur in trials of treatments for other diseases. When switching occurs, an “intention to treat” (ITT) analysis – whereby the data are analysed according to the arms to which patients were randomised – of the overall survival (OS) advantage associated with the new treatment will be biased: If control group patients switch treatments and benefit from the new treatment the OS advantage of the new treatment will be underestimated. Various statistical methods are available to adjust survival estimates in the presence of treatment switching, but each makes important assumptions and is subject to limitations. This Technical Support Document (TSD) introduces Rank Preserving Structural Failure Time Models (RPSFTM), Iterative Parameter Estimation (IPE), Inverse Probability of Censoring Weights (IPCW) and other adjustment methods that may be used in the presence of treatment switching.

Personalized Evaluation of Biomarker Value: A Cost-Benefit Perspective.
Huang Y1, Laber E2.
Author information
Abstract

For a patient who is facing a treatment decision, the added value of information provided by a biomarker depends on the individual patient's expected response to treatment with and without the biomarker, as well as his/her tolerance of disease and treatment harm. However, individualized estimators of the value of a biomarker are lacking. We propose a new graphical tool named the subject-specific expected benefit curve for quantifying the personalized value of a biomarker in aiding a treatment decision. We develop semiparametric estimators for two general settings: (i) when biomarker data are available from a randomized trial; and (ii) when biomarker data are available from a cohort or a cross-sectional study, together with external information about a multiplicative treatment effect. We also develop adaptive bootstrap confidence intervals for consistent inference in the presence of nonregularity. The proposed method is used to evaluate the individualized value of the serum creatinine marker in informing treatment decisions for the prevention of renal artery stenosis.

Abstract

Thymomas are often associated with a variety of autoimmune diseases, mostly myasthenia gravis. The association of thymomas with both pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) and Good's syndrome is exceedingly rare. To the best of our knowledge, the combination of a thymoma with manifestations of myasthenia gravis, PRCA, and Good's syndrome, as in our case herein, has not been described before in the medical literature. We present a 90-year-old man initially diagnosed with an asymptomatic thymoma. Later, he developed generalized muscle weakness and was found to have severe anemia. He was diagnosed with PRCA, myasthenia gravis and Good's syndrome. He responded to rituximab with restoration of bone marrow erythroid maturation and stabilization of red blood cell counts.

Abstract
AIM OF THE STUDY:

Positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET CT) scan is commonly used in current medical oncology practice as an imaging method. In this study we present data from cancer patients who were followed at our clinic and suspected of having tuberculosis during PET CT scanning. After the biopsy, they were diagnosed with concomitant tuberculosis.
MATERIAL AND METHODS:

In this study, 14 patients who applied to our clinic and followed up due to cancer, and had PET CT scanning for the preliminary staging or further evaluation, were included. The patients were diagnosed with metastatic or recurrent disease, and their biopsy results revealed tuberculosis.
RESULTS:

The mean age was 57.8 years with SD (standard deviation) 13.1 years and gender distribution of 78.6% (n = 11) females and 21.4% (n = 3) males. None of the patients had tuberculosis in their personal history (0%). Among the patients, 5 (35.7%) were diagnosed with tuberculosis during the preliminary staging, whereas 9 (64.3%) were diagnosed during the follow-up after the treatment. The median time to tuberculosis diagnosis was 11 months (min-max: 3-24 months) after the treatment. The most commonly involved lymph nodes during PET CT scanning were mediastinal in 8 (64.3%), axillary in 3 (21.4%) and para-aortic in 3 (21.4%) patients. The mean SUVmax (maximum standardised uptake value) of lymph node involved by PET CT scanning was defined as 8.5 (SD 2.6).
CONCLUSIONS:

Despite all improvements in modern medicine, tuberculosis is still a serious public health problem. It should always be considered in differential diagnosis while evaluating PET CT scanning results of cancer patients, because it may cause false positive results.

When the treatment stops: A qualitative study of life post breast cancer treatment.
Powers N1, Gullifer J2, Shaw R1.
Author information
Abstract

Public attention focuses on breast cancer treatment and fundraising; however, there is limited discussion about life post-treatment. Once treatment is complete, there can be societal expectations of newfound wellness. To understand this phenomenon, the narratives of nine women post-treatment were explored. Analysis revealed the adoption of the sick role by the participants, the vulnerability experienced with the cessation of treatment, the disturbance of moving on from the security of the medical system and the patient and doctor relationship. Findings emphasised that survivorship can remain challenging and can present adverse psychosocial implications for women and those close to them.

The effect of benzo[α]pyrene on expression and signaling cross talk of aryl hydrocarbon receptor and NFATc1 in mouse lung tissue.
Parsa M1, Ostad SN1, Moogahi SM2, Bayat M2, Ghahremani MH3.
Author information
Abstract
OBJECTIVE:

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are potent environmental pollutants. Benzo[α]pyrene (B[α]P) is the major compound of PAHs that acts by activating aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in cells. B[α]P is a known carcinogen and an immunotoxicant; however, its role with regard to nuclear factor of activated T cell (NFAT) pathway is unclear. AhR and NFAT signaling pathways have common roles in pathological functions in immunotoxicity and lung cancer. In this study, the effect of AhR activation on expression and signaling cross talk of AhR and NFATc1 pathways in mouse lung tissue has been investigated.
METHODS:

Swiss albino mice were randomly allocated to five groups and administered with cyclosporin A (CsA) and B[α]P for seven constitutive days. Animals were then killed, and lung tissues were obtained after washing the whole blood. Paraffin-embedded blocks were prepared, and 5 µm sections were cut for histopathological and immunohistochemical assessments. The results were scored by observer and digitally analyzed using ImageJ software.
RESULTS:

Our data showed that CsA administration resulted in a significant reduction of AhR expression. This effect was partly blocked in mice coadministrated with B[α]P and CsA. NFATc1 expression was also reduced in CsA-treated animals. Furthermore, CsA inhibited the pathological effects of B[α]P in mouse lung tissue.
CONCLUSION:

AhR expression is dependent on NFATc1 activation, and NFATc1 inhibition remarkably decreases AhR expression. However, it seems that total expression of NFATc1 is not dependent on AhR expression or activation. Moreover, CsA can prevent B[α]P-induced lung tissue damage, and it remarkably decreases NFATc1 expression. The results from this study point toward the molecular interactions of AhR and NFATc1 activation in lung tissue and the benefit of CsA treatment in B[α]P-induced lung damage.

Biosynthesis of metallic nanoparticles using plant derivatives and their new avenues in pharmacological applications - An updated report.
Kuppusamy P1, Yusoff MM1, Maniam GP1, Govindan N1.
Author information
Abstract

The field of nanotechnology mainly encompasses with biology, physics, chemistry and material sciences and it develops novel therapeutic nanosized materials for biomedical and pharmaceutical applications. The biological syntheses of nanoparticles are being carried out by different macro-microscopic organisms such as plant, bacteria, fungi, seaweeds and microalgae. The biosynthesized nanomaterials have been effectively controlling the various endemic diseases with less adverse effect. Plant contains abundant natural compounds such as alkaloids, flavonoids, saponins, steroids, tannins and other nutritional compounds. These natural products are derived from various parts of plant such as leaves, stems, roots shoots, flowers, barks, and seeds. Recently, many studies have proved that the plant extracts act as a potential precursor for the synthesis of nanomaterial in non-hazardous ways. Since the plant extract contains various secondary metabolites, it acts as reducing and stabilizing agents for the bioreduction reaction to synthesized novel metallic nanoparticles. The non-biological methods (chemical and physical) are used in the synthesis of nanoparticles, which has a serious hazardous and high toxicity for living organisms. In addition, the biological synthesis of metallic nanoparticles is inexpensive, single step and eco-friendly methods. The plants are used successfully in the synthesis of various greener nanoparticles such as cobalt, copper, silver, gold, palladium, platinum, zinc oxide and magnetite. Also, the plant mediated nanoparticles are potential remedy for various diseases such as malaria, cancer, HIV, hepatitis and other acute diseases.

Panacea seed "Nigella": A review focusing on regenerative effects for gastric ailments.
Khan SA1, Khan AM1, Karim S2, Kamal MA1, Damanhouri GA1, Mirza Z1.
Author information
Abstract

Nigella sativa (NS) or black cumin is a dark, thin, and crescent-shaped, seeded shrub belonging to the Ranunculaceae family commonly growing on Mediterranean coasts in Saudi Arabia, northern Africa and Asia. They have amazing curative and therapeutic features that make them one of the most popular, safe, non-detrimental, and cytoprotective medicinal plant that can be used for prevention and treatment of many complicated diseases. Originally, N. sativa was used to treat migraines and allergy, and researches have shown its effectiveness in destroying cancer cells as well. The gastro protective effect of NS oil and its constituents has also been reported earlier; however, the complete perception on etiology and pathogenesis of gastric ulcer is not yet clear. Herein, we attempt to unveil some of the potential mechanisms exhibited by NS in preventing problems related to gastric ulcers. Gastric ailments like ulcers and tumors are the most common disorders of the gastro-intestinal tract in the present day life of the industrialized world. Gastric ulcer being a multifaceted problem exhibits complex etiology and is the fourth most common cause of cancer mortality. Drug interactions and toxicity are the main hindrances in chemotherapy. The existing merits and demerits of modern-day drugs make us turn toward the plant kingdom which may provide a valuable resource of novel potent natural compounds for pharmaceuticals or alternately, as dietary supplements. In this context, the revered phytotherapeutic N. sativa comes as a promising savior in today's times. This review aims to summarize, both the functional and disease-related effects in the area of gastroenterology.

Excerpt

An estimated 250,000 Canadians have chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection; however, the exact number affected is not known, as 30% to 70% of patients are unaware that they have been infected and limited population level surveillance has been carried out in Canada to document prevalent cases. While the incidence of HCV infection in the US and Canada appears to be stable or declining, liver-related morbidity and mortality are expected to increase over the coming decades, as those who are already infected age and develop progressive liver disease. Since the early 2000s, pegylated interferon plus ribavirin (PR) has been the standard therapy for chronic hepatitis C (CHC). When effective, treatment leads to viral eradication or sustained virologic response (SVR), which is a virologic cure of infection, associated with improved long-term clinical outcomes. In patients with advanced fibrosis or cirrhosis at baseline, SVR is associated with reduced liver-related and all-cause mortality as well as a reduced incidence of liver failure and liver cancer. Although treatment with PR results in SVR in a proportion of patients, the treatment is less than ideal because of its long duration, numerous associated side effects, and relatively low efficacy. In 2011, the first two direct-acting antiviral (DAA) agents, boceprevir and telaprevir, were approved for use in combination with PR for patients with genotype 1 CHC. Recently, two new DAA agents (simeprevir and sofosbuvir) have been approved by Health Canada for use in patients with genotype 1 CHC, in combination with PR therapy. Given the market entry of two new DAA agents, there is a need to determine the relative effectiveness, safety, and cost-effectiveness of approved treatments for genotype 1 CHC. Genotype 1 CHC is the most prevalent form of CHC infection in Canada, and it is also the least responsive to PR treatment. Despite the availability of boceprevir and telaprevir, a substantial unmet need remains. Th expressed the need for new treatments that have higher cure rates, better side effect profiles and reduced treatment burden, yet remain affordable and accessible. The introduction of the new DAA agents (simeprevir and sofosbuvir) may address some unmet needs the treatment burden is high for regimens that require 48 weeks of therapy, and for treatment regimens that include PR. Patients haverough potentially higher cure rates, more favourable adverse event profiles, shorter treatment durations, or combinations of these. However, treatment costs remain a concern. This review was undertaken to address policy questions put forward by the public drug plans in Canada (excluding Quebec), as described in the Therapeutic Review protocol. Specifically, this review is meant to inform formulary listing decisions for the four DAA therapies for the treatment of CHC genotype 1 by identifying the most cost-effective strategies, based on patient characteristics and prior treatment history. Key patient characteristics examined include liver fibrosis severity, genotype subtype, and HCV Q80K polymorphism (an amino acid substitution associated with resistance to simeprevir and possibly other protease inhibitors).

Cancer Stem Cells: Dynamic Entities in an Ever-Evolving Paradigm.
Lopez-Bertoni H1, Li Y2, Laterra J2.
Author information
Abstract

The cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis postulates that there is a hierarchy of cellular differentiation within cancers and that the bulk population of tumor cells is derived from a relatively small population of multi-potent neoplastic stem-like cells (CSCs). This tumor-initiating cell population plays an important role in maintaining tumor growth through their unlimited self-renewal, therapeutic resistance, and capacity to propagate tumors through asymmetric cell division. Recent findings from multiple laboratories show that cancer progenitor cells have the capacity to de-differentiate and acquire a stem-like phenotype in response to either genetic manipulation or environmental cues. These findings suggest that CSCs and relatively differentiated progenitors coexist in dynamic equilibrium and are subject to bidirectional conversion. In this review, we discuss emerging concepts regarding the stem-like phenotype, its acquisition by cancer progenitor cells, and the molecular mechanisms involved. Understanding the dynamic equilibrium between CSCs and cancer progenitor cells is critical for the development of novel therapeutic strategies that focus on depleting tumors of their tumor-propagating cell population.

Abstract

A strategic challenge facing clinicians treating patients afflicted with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the development of approaches that combine conventional and novel therapies, including targeted therapies and immunotherapeutics. In a recent study, we explored the correlation between the expression of the tumor antigen family MAGE-A and the presence of EGFR and KRAS gene mutations in a large cohort of resected NSCLC patient specimens.

Abstract
OBJECTIVES:

To assess the preoperative serum levels of CA 125 with its diagnostic role and to evaluate the p53 expression in patients of primary ovarian neoplasms. We also wished to judge their relationship with other parameters like clinical staging and histopathologic tumor type.
MATERIALS AND METHODS:

The present study was conducted on 86 patients during the study period of 2.5 years. Preoperative CA 125 levels were evaluated by an automated immunoassay analyzer. p53 expression was judged immunohistochemically with pre-diluted monoclonal antibody. An objective scoring was done depending on distinct nuclear immunopositivity.
RESULTS:

Median value of preoperative CA 125 levels was 32 U/mL in benign surface epithelial-stromal tumors (BSEST), 53 U/mL in borderline surface epithelial-stromal tumors (BOT), 346 U/mL in malignant surface epithelial-stromal tumors (MSEST) and 560 U/mL in serous adenocarcinomas (SAC). Most of ovarian tumors were in the FIGO stage I (64 cases, 74.4%), but higher stages (II, III, IV) were observed mostly in MSESTs. SACs displayed the maximum p53 expression. Considering the cut-off value of more than 35 U/mL in CA 125 levels, the sensitivity to diagnose MSESTs was 94.7%. Preoperative CA 125 levels strongly and positively correlated with FIGO staging and p53 expression. Similarly p53 expression strongly and positively correlated with FIGO staging and histopathological categories.
CONCLUSION:

Higher values of preoperative CA 125 levels and higher expression p53 are associated with MSESTs and BOTs especially of serous type. They strongly correlate with each other and with tumor stage. But there is no serum CA 125 concentration that can clearly differentiate benign and malignant ovarian masses.

Endoscopic submucosal dissection and its potential role in the management of early colorectal neoplasia in UK.
Hayward C1, Uraoka T2, Yahagi N2.
Author information
Abstract

In Europe, colorectal cancer is the most common newly diagnosed cancer and the second most common cause of cancer deaths, accounting for approximately 436 000 incident cases and 212 000 deaths in 2008. National screening programmes will increase the number of early (pT1) cancers detected. pT1 cancers are those showing invasion through the muscularis mucosae into the submucosa but not into the muscularis propria. Microstaging of pT1 cancer is crucial in predicting those cases less likely to cause nodal disease and that will be cured with endoscopic resection alone. The submucosal extent and other histological features predict the risk of nodal disease, and for this reason, en bloc resection is highly desirable. Endoscopic submucosal dissection enables en bloc resection of mucosal and submucosal disease and could reduce the need for surgery in some cases by definitive initial resection.

Abstract
Several cases of acquired resistance in patients with activating epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation have been reported. However, rare clinical cases exist of a transformation to small cell lung cancer (SCLC) following treatment with EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). We report a case of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with L858R mutation at the time of diagnosis. After failure of EGFR-TKI therapy, we performed additional histopathologic examinations. We confirmed that the patient had a histological transformation from NSCLC to SCLC. We performed chemotherapy with etoposide and cisplatin against the SCLC and radiologic findings were improved.

Abstract
AIM OF THE STUDY:
F-18 FDG PET/CT is the most effective method for demonstrating extrapulmonary metastases of lung cancer. The aim of this study is to investigate the level of muscular metastasis of non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) in F-18 FDG PET/CT and to demonstrate the characteristics of this special group of patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS:
A total of 1150 patients with the diagnosis of NSCLC, who were referred for F-18 FDG PET/CT, were included into the study. Among these patients, the findings of 13 who were shown to have muscle metastases were studied.
RESULTS:
In the retrospective analysis of the patients, 13 patients (12 male, 1 female; mean: 59 ±7 years old) were found to have haematogenous (excluding local invasion) muscular metastases of NSCLC using F-18 FDG PET/CT. Two of the 13 patients had only muscular metastases (one patient isolated, one patient two foci). The other 11 patients had additional distant metastases in six metastatic sites (bone in 7 patients, distant lymph node in 6, adrenal gland in 5, contralateral lung in 3, liver in 1, and brain metastasis in 1 patient). Five patients died during the mean 11 ±8 months follow up.
CONCLUSIONS:
Muscular metastasis is not a rare condition, especially in F-18 FDG PET/CT examinations, and is frequently associated with additional distant metastases.

Statins and cancers.

Stryjkowska-Góra A1, Karczmarek-Borowska B2, Góra T3, Krawczak K1.
Author information
Abstract
Statins (inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase) are a group of drugs used to treat lipid disorders. They inhibit cholesterol synthesis at an early stage of the biosynthesis pathway, thus eliminating numerous metabolites involved in the cycle. Numerous studies point to different possible effects of statins on cancer cells. Statins inhibit growth of a tumor, invasion and metastasis formation. They block the production of isoprenoids, which are necessary for post-translational modifications of many proteins, including those involved in normal cell signaling. They also contribute to the reduction in the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor, sensitize tumor cells to NK cell activity, and modify the body inflammatory response. Due to different pharmacokinetic properties of individual statins, they may have opposite effects on the risk of cancer. Currently, most information on the effects of statins on the risk of developing cancer is obtained from observational studies. The studies have different results depending on the location of cancer. The protective effect of statins was observed in the meta-analysis of numerous studies including prostate cancer, stomach cancer, esophagus cancer, and hepatocellular carcinoma; however, it has not yet been confirmed that statins influence the risk of developing colorectal cancer, breast cancer, or lung cancer. The protective effect of statins on the development of many kinds of cancer can be a valuable and easy way to reduce morbidity. However, further research is necessary to thoroughly determine the value of this group of drugs.

Abstract
PURPOSE:
The purpose of this study was to understand factors related to recruitment to behavioral intervention trials among Spanish-speaking urban Hispanic breast cancer (BC) survivors.
METHODS:
Potentially eligible Hispanic BC survivors were recruited from the Columbia University Breast Oncology Clinic, signed informed consent, and completed a screening interview on demographics, medical history, acculturation (Short Acculturation Scale for Hispanics), quality of life (QOL), and perceived benefits/risks of research participation. Trial eligibility criteria included stage 0-III BC, completion of adjuvant treatment, Hispanic, fluency in Spanish, willing to be randomized to active arm (9-session in-person culturally-based ¡Cocinar para su salud! dietary modification program) or control arm (written materials). We compared characteristics between eligible women who did and did not enroll in the trial.
RESULTS:
102 women completed the screening interview and were eligible to participate. Overall mean age was 57.3 ± 9.5 years, mean time since diagnosis was 3.4 ± 2.1 years, 71% reported annual household income <$15,000 and mean acculturation index score was 1.6 ± 0.6 (scale 1-5, low-high). Of the 102 women, 70 enrolled and 32 declined participation. Reasons stated for non-participation included lack of interest in dietary change, illness, and work constraints. Compared to women who enrolled, women who did not enroll were less likely to be employed (P=0.03) and more likely to only read/speak Spanish (P=0.02). Compared to women who enrolled, non-enrollers were more likely to state that research is costly to participants (P=0.03).
CONCLUSION:
Lower participation was associated with unemployment, monolingualism, and the perception that research is costly to participants. Future behavioral intervention trials among minority BC survivors need to account for these and other factors that may be related to trial participation.

Exposure to ionizing radiation reveals global dose- and time-dependent changes in the urinary metabolome of rat.

Abstract
The potential for exposures to ionizing radiation has increased in recent years. Although advances have been made, understanding the global metabolic response as a function of both dose and exposure time is challenging considering the complexity of the responses. Herein we report our findings on the dose- and time-dependency of the urinary response to ionizing radiation in the male rat using radiation metabolomics. Urine samples were collected from adult male rats, exposed to 0.5 to 10 Gy γ-radiation, both before from 6 to 72 h following exposures. Samples were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and deconvoluted mass chromatographic data were initially analyzed by principal component analysis. However, the breadth and complexity of the data necessitated the development of a novel approach to summarizing biofluid constituents after exposure, called Visual Analysis of Metabolomics Package (VAMP). VAMP revealed clear urine metabolite profile differences to as little as 0.5 Gy after 6 h exposure. Via VAMP, it was discovered that the response to radiation exposure found in rat urine is characterized by an overall net down-regulation of ion excretion with only a modest number of ions excreted in excess over pre-exposure levels. Our results show both similarities and differences with the published mouse urine response and a dose- and time-dependent net decrease in urine ion excretion associated with radiation exposure. These findings mark an important step in the development of minimally invasive radiation biodosimetry. VAMP should have general applicability in metabolomics to visualize overall differences and trends in many sample sets.

Abstract
BACKGROUND:
Benzimidazoles and triazoles are useful structures for research and development of new pharmaceutical molecules and have received much attention in the last decade because of their highly potent medicinal activities.
FINDINGS:
A simple and efficient synthesis of triazole was carried out by treatment of 2-(4-azidophenyl)-1H-benzo[d]imidazole (6) with different types of terminal alkynes in t-BuOH/H2O, sodium ascorbate, and Zn(OTf)2, screened for cytotoxicity assay and achieved good results. A series of new benzimidazole-linked 1,2,3-triazole (8a-i) congeners were synthesized through cyclization of terminal alkynes and azide. These synthesized congeners 8a-i were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against five human cancer cell lines. These benzimidazole-linked 1,2,3-triazole derivatives have shown promising activity with IC50 values ranging from 0.1 to 43 μM. Among them, the compounds (8a, 8b, 8c, and 8e) showed comparable cytotoxicity with adriamycin control drug.
CONCLUSIONS:
In conclusion, we have developed a simple, convenient, and an efficient convergent approach for the synthesis of benzimidazole-linked 1,2,3-triazole congeners as agents. Graphical Abstract Synthesis of 1,2,3-triazole derivatives.

BACKGROUND:
The current investigation sought to explore the nature of the secondary metabolites in the algae, Laurencia pacifica.
RESULTS:
This report details the first isolation of the sesquiterpenes isoaplysin (1), isolaurenisol (2), debromoisolaurinterol (3), debromoaplysinol (4), laur-11-en-10-ol (5), 10α-hydroxyldebromoepiaplysin (6), and the previously unknown 10-bromo-3,7,11,11-tetramethylspiro[5.5]undeca-1,7-dien-3-ol (7) from the algae, Laurencia pacifica. Isoaplysin (1) and debromoaplysinol (4) showed promising levels of growth inhibition against a panel cancer-derived cell lines of colon (HT29), glioblastoma (U87, SJ-G2), breast (MCF-7), ovarian (A2780), lung (H460), skin (A431), prostate (Du145), neuroblastoma (BE2-C), pancreas (MIA), murine glioblastoma (SMA) origin with average GI50 values of 23 and 14 μM.
CONCLUSIONS:
Isoaplysin (1) and debromoaplysinol (4) were up to fourfold more potent in cancer-derived cell populations than in non-tumor-derived normal cells (MCF10A). These analogues are promising candidates for anticancer drug development. Graphical Abstract ᅟ.

Abstract
Epidemiologic studies have linked diesel exhaust (DE) to cardiovascular and respiratory morbidity and mortality, as well as lung cancer. DE composition is known to vary with many factors, although it is unclear how this influences toxicity. We generated eight DE atmospheres by applying a 2×2×2 factorial design and altering three parameters in a controlled exposure facility: (1) engine load (27 vs 82 %), (2) particle aging (residence time ~5 s vs ~5 min prior to particle collection), and (3) oxidation (with or without ozonation during dilution). Selected exposure concentrations of both diesel exhaust particles (DEPs) and DE gases, DEP oxidative reactivity via DTT activity, and in vitro DEP toxicity in murine endothelial cells were measured for each DE atmosphere. Cell toxicity was assessed via measurement of cell proliferation (colony formation assay), cell viability (MTT assay), and wound healing (scratch assay). Differences in DE composition were observed as a function of engine load. The mean 1-nitropyrene concentration was 15 times higher and oxidative reactivity was two times higher for low engine load versus high load. There were no substantial differences in measured toxicity among the three DE exposure parameters. These results indicate that alteration of applied engine load shifts the composition and can modify the biological reactivity of DE. While engine conditions did not affect the selected in vitro toxicity measures, the change in oxidative reactivity suggests that toxicological studies with DE need to take into account engine conditions in characterizing biological effects.

Psychometric Evaluation of the Lower Extremity Computerized Adaptive Test, the Modified Harris Hip Score, and the Hip Outcome Score.

Hung M1, Hon SD2, Cheng C3, Franklin JD4, Aoki SK5, Anderson MB5, Kapron AL5, Peters CL5, Pelt CE5.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:
The applicability and validity of many patient-reported outcome measures in the high-functioning population are not well understood.
PURPOSE:
To compare the psychometric properties of the modified Harris Hip Score (mHHS), the Hip Outcome Score activities of daily living subscale (HOS-ADL) and sports (HOS-sports), and the Lower Extremity Computerized Adaptive Test (LE CAT). The hypotheses was that all instruments would perform well but that the LE CAT would show superiority psychometrically because a combination of CAT and a large item bank allows for a high degree of measurement precision.
STUDY DESIGN:
Cohort study (diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2.
METHODS:
Data were collected from 472 advanced-age, active participants from the Huntsman World Senior Games in 2012. Validity evidences were examined through item fit, dimensionality, monotonicity, local independence, differential item functioning, person raw score to measure correlation, and instrument coverage (ie, ceiling and floor effects), and reliability evidences were examined through Cronbach alpha and person separation index.
RESULTS:
All instruments demonstrated good item fit, unidimensionality, monotonicity, local independence, and person raw score to measure correlations. The HOS-ADL had high ceiling effects of 36.02%, and the mHHS had ceiling effects of 27.54%. The LE CAT had ceiling effects of 8.47%, and the HOS-sports had no ceiling effects. None of the instruments had any floor effects. The mHHS had a very low Cronbach alpha of 0.41 and an extremely low person separation index of 0.08. Reliabilities for the LE CAT were excellent and for the HOS-ADL and HOS-sports were good.
CONCLUSION:
The LE CAT showed better psychometric properties overall than the HOS-ADL, HOS-sports, and mHHS for the senior population. The mHHS demonstrated pronounced ceiling effects and poor reliabilities that should be of concern. The high ceiling effects for the HOS-ADL were also of concern. The LE CAT was superior in all psychometric aspects examined in this study. Future research should investigate the LE CAT for wider use in different populations.

Cytoreductive Surgery and HIPEC in the Baltic States: An International Scientific Workshop with Live Surgery.

Poskus E1, Strupas K2, Gushchin V3, Sugarbaker PH4.
Author information
Abstractin English, German
BACKGROUND:
Around the globe a new interest in the multidisciplinary management of peritoneal metastases using neoadjuvant chemotherapy, cytoreductive surgery (CRS), hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC), and adjuvant systemic chemotherapy has occurred. The combined use of these treatment modalities has required the creation of centers of excellence to manage patients with peritoneal metastases with a high level of success as well as a low incidence of adverse events.
METHODS:
A 2-day workshop hosted by the Center of Abdominal Surgery, Vilnius University Hospital, with 230 participants was organized to explore the current practice in the Baltic states. Live surgery with video transmission initiated the efforts. Then, presentations by five experts from high-volume peritoneal surface malignancy centers were made and discussed. A summary of the efforts to date in Lithuania and Estonia was presented and collected for publication.
RESULTS:
The live surgery served as a focal point for all subsequent presentations. The five invited speakers reviewed the rationale, current literature, indications and contraindications, implementation, and current European guidelines for management. The results of CRS and HIPEC from five centers in Lithuania and Estonia currently active revealed 127 patients treated to date, half of whom carried a diagnosis of ovarian cancer. There was an incidence of major complications of 11.8% and a mortality of 1.6%. Data regarding long-term survival benefits will require further follow-up.
CONCLUSIONS:
Progress in peritoneal surface oncology in the Baltic states was confirmed. With a low morbidity and mortality, these clinical programs promise to provide continued benefit for patients with peritoneal metastases - a condition judged to be terminal in the past.

Abstract
The purpose of this study was to evaluate the incidence and characteristics of patients with port-site metastasis following robotic assisted surgery for gynecological malignancies. Patients who underwent robotic assisted total laparoscopic hysterectomy and surgical staging at a single institution from November 2006 through November 2011 were retrospectively identified. Medical records were reviewed and the following information was extracted: diagnosis, histology, tumor extension, procedure, complications and post-surgical intervention. Port-site metastases were differentiated between isolated and not isolated. All metastases were confirmed with biopsy and treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy as indicated. Four hundred forty-six patients with endometrial carcinoma were identified who had undergone robotic assisted hysterectomy and staging. Eight patients were converted to laparotomy and excluded from the study. Of 438 patients, 384 patients were diagnosed with early stages (stages 1 and 2), and 54 were diagnosed with advanced stages (stages 3 and 4). A total of 332 patients underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy regardless of the endometrial cancer stage; of those, 283 with early stage disease underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy, while 49 with advanced stage disease underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy. One hundred seventy-six patients received adjuvant treatment after surgical staging. Four patients were identified with port-site metastases (0.9 %), two patients were reported as isolated metastases. The mean patient age was 63 and mean BMI was 37 kg/m(2). The incidence of port-site metastasis is low after robotic assisted surgery for treatment of endometrial cancer (0.9 %). There is no clear risk factor for development of port-site metastasis or easily identifiable prevention.

Abstract
The introduction of robotic surgery into clinical practice brings new and specific needs for education and training. Application to the pediatric setting comes with unique considerations, warranting dedicated training resources that are accessible. A pediatric robotic surgery workshop was convened to address initial education and training requirements. The event was designed to offer an exposure rich environment for delegates to familiarize and learn basic principles in a maximally efficient manner. Pre- and post-workshop survey responses were evaluated to reflect on the quality of the educational experience and scope for improvement. Feasibility and sustainability of such events was further evaluated by reviewing various challenges encountered. A total of 29 surgeons participated in the workshop, with 7 countries represented. The majority of delegates (94 %) indicated they were "very satisfied" with the overall program. Delegates almost unanimously expressed preference and satisfaction for hands-on content. Qualitative feedback favored a stepwise and modular workshop structure, transitioning from didactic teaching to progressively more advanced training. At the basic and intermediate level, this style of event is able to satisfy initial training and educational needs. Feasibility and sustainability of such events is highly dependent on infrastructure resources that have numerous barriers to accessibility.

Abstract
The background of the study was to examine potential causes for a positive surgical margin (PSM) and develop strategies to improve surgical outcomes. A retrospective review of consecutive partial nephrectomy cases for renal cell carcinoma was performed. We divided the patients into 2 groups. The first group consisted of the first 67 renal tumors in 65 patients that underwent our early surgical technique. The second group consisted of the next 45 renal tumors in 39 patients that underwent the revised surgical technique which included wider resections and robotically controlled ultrasound. Our primary outcome was margin status and secondary outcome was disease recurrence. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to determine factors that resulted in a PSM. Positive margins were detected in 19 out of 67 (28 %) renal tumors in the early technique group compared to 1 out of 45 (2 %) positive margins in the revised technique group (p < 0.001). On multivariate analysis, only technique modification (OR 0.04, p = 0.003) and larger tumor size (OR 0.41, p = 0.01) were significant predictors of a lower rate of PSM. Smaller tumors were more common in robotic assisted partial nephrectomies which had a higher rate of PSM on univariate analysis (OR 3.51, p = 0.04). Only one patient with a PSM experienced a systemic disease recurrence. In our experience, self-assessment and technique modification resulted in a dramatic PSM improvement. Smaller tumors were associated with PSM. It is important for all surgeons to periodically look at their own surgical outcomes and modify their surgical technique accordingly.

Abstract
BACKGROUND:
The cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) pathway has been implicated in the molecular pathogenesis of many malignancies, including lung cancer. Apricoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, has been described to inhibit epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in human malignancies. The mechanism by which apricoxib may alter the tumor microenvironment by affecting EMT through other important signaling pathways is poorly defined. IL-27 has been shown to have anti-tumor activity and our recent study showed that IL-27 inhibited EMT through a STAT1 dominant pathway.
OBJECTIVE:
The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of apricoxib combined with IL-27 in inhibiting lung carcinogenesis by modulation of EMT through STAT signaling.
METHODS AND RESULTS:
Western blot analysis revealed that IL-27 stimulation of human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines results in STAT1 and STAT3 activation, decreased Snail protein and mesenchymal markers (N-cadherin and vimentin) and a concomitant increase in expression of epithelial markers (E-cadherin, β-and γ-catenins), and inhibition of cell migration. The combination of apricoxib and IL-27 resulted in augmentation of STAT1 activation. However, IL-27 mediated STAT3 activation was decreased by the addition of apricoxib. STAT1 siRNA was used to determine the involvement of STAT1 pathway in the enhanced inhibition of EMT and cell migration by the combined IL-27 and apricoxib treatment. Pretreatment of cells with STAT1 siRNA inhibited the effect of combined IL-27 and apricoxib in the activation of STAT1 and STAT3. In addition, the augmented expression of epithelial markers, decreased expression mesenchymal markers, and inhibited cell migration by the combination treatment were also inhibited by STAT1 siRNA, suggesting that the STAT1 pathway is important in the enhanced effect from the combination treatment.
CONCLUSION:
Combined apricoxib and IL-27 has an enhanced effect in inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transition and cell migration in human lung cancer cells through a STAT1 dominant pathway.

Pain services and palliative medicine - an integrated approach to pain management in the cancer patient.

O'Brien T1, Kane CM2.
Author information
Abstract
The vast majority of cancer patients will experience pain during the course of their illness. Thankfully, in most instances, the consistent application of analgesic guidelines, tailored to the unique needs of each individual patient, will deliver a satisfactory outcome. These guidelines recommend the skilled use of analgesic medications, often in conjunction with a range of adjuvant therapies as may be required. Despite the consistent and rational application of such strategies, it is recognised that a small but significant proportion of cancer patients continue to experience more refractory pain. In addition, these patients may experience a plethora of unwanted dose-limiting side effects associated with their analgesic medication, sometimes even at low dose. All such patients with more complex and refractory pain syndromes require a more comprehensive review and many will require interventional therapy and/or adjuvant approaches. Unfortunately, the availability and accessibility of such services are variable. Even in circumstances in which palliative medicine and pain services co-exist in the same region, there may be poor integration between the two services. Each specialty area holds a unique set of skills and competencies, yet there is considerable overlap. Patient care and outcomes will be enhanced by establishing more formal relationships between these two specialty areas.

Abstract
Mechanisms of inflammatory and neuropathic pains have been elucidated and translated to patient care by the use of animal models of these pain states. Cancer pain has lagged behind since early animal models of cancer-induced bone pain were based on the systemic injection of carcinoma cells. This precluded systematic investigation of specific neuronal and pharmacological alterations that occur in cancer-induced bone pain. In 1999, Schwei et al. described a murine model of cancer-induced bone pain that paralleled the clinical condition in terms of pain development and bone destruction, confined to the mouse femur. This model prompted related approaches, and we can now state that cancer pain may include elements of inflammatory and neuropathic pains but also unique changes in sensory processing. Cancer-induced bone pain results in progressive bone destruction, elevated osteoclast activity and distinctive nocifensive behaviours (indicating the triad of ongoing, spontaneous and movement-induced hyperalgesia). In addition, cancer cells induce an inflammatory infiltrate and release growth factors, cytokines, interleukins, chemokines, prostanoids and endothelins, resulting in a reduction of pH to below 5 and direct deformation of primary afferents within bone. These peripheral changes, in turn, drive hypersensitivity of spinal cord sensory neurons, many of which project to the parts of the brain involved in the emotional response to pain. Within the spinal cord, a unique neuronal function reorganization within segments of the dorsal horn of the spinal cord receiving nociceptive input from the bone are discussed. Changes in certain neurotransmitters implicated in brain modulation of spinal function are also altered with implications for the affective components of cancer pain. Treatments are described in terms of mechanistic insights and in the case of opioids, which modulate pain transmission at spinal and supraspinal sites, their use can be compromised by opioid-induced hyperalgesia. We discuss evidence for how this comes about and how it may be treated.

Pain in cancer survivors.

Brown MR1, Ramirez JD2, Farquhar-Smith P3.
Author information
Abstract
Cancer and its treatment exert a heavy psychological and physical toll. Of the myriad symptoms which result, pain is common, encountered in between 30% and 60% of cancer survivors. Pain in cancer survivors is a major and growing problem, impeding the recovery and rehabilitation of patients who have beaten cancer and negatively impacting on cancer patients' quality of life, work prospects and mental health. Persistent pain in cancer survivors remains challenging to treat successfully. Pain can arise both due to the underlying disease and the various treatments the patient has been subjected to. Chemotherapy causes painful chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN), radiotherapy can produce late effect radiation toxicity and surgery may lead to the development of persistent post-surgical pain syndromes. This review explores a selection of the common causes of persistent pain in cancer survivors, detailing our current understanding of the pathophysiology and outlining both the clinical manifestations of individual pain states and the treatment options available.

The Role of Spirituality in the Lives of Mothers of Breast Cancer Survivors.

Manning LK1, Radina ME2.
Author information
Abstract
Breast cancer impacts an entire family system. A cancer diagnosis embeds the patient/survivor and their loved ones in the illness process. The mothers of breast cancer patients are likely impacted in a variety of ways by their daughters' diagnoses. To date, few researchers have investigated the experiences and perspectives of this population. In the present study, authors explored how mothers of breast cancer survivors managed adversities associated with this disease and illness. Using secondary data and narrative analysis, investigators analyzed data gathered from 30 mothers. Findings indicate that participants relied on their spirituality for the management of stress and hardship related to having a loved one with breast cancer. This research has implications for family health and well-being.

Knowledge, attitudes and practices of oral health care workers in Lesotho regarding the management of patients with oral manifestations of HIV/AIDS.

Ramphoma KJ, Naidoo S.
Abstract
Lesotho has the third highest prevalence of HIV in the world with an estimated 23% of the adult population infected. At least 70% of people living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) have presented with oral manifestation of HIV as the first sign of the disease. Oral health workers regularly encounter patients presenting with oral lesions associated with HIV disease and therefore need to have adequate knowledge of these conditions for diagnosis and management. The aim of the present study was to determine the knowledge, attitudes and practices of oral health care workers (OHCW) of Lesotho regarding the management of oral manifestations of HIV/AIDS. A descriptive cross-sectional survey was conducted on all 46 OHCW in 26 public and private care facilities in all ten districts of Lesotho. A self-administered questionnaire was used to gather information. The response rate was 100%. Nearly all (94.7%) agreed that oral lesions are common in people living with HIV and/or AIDS. The majority (91.3%) named oral candidiasis (OC) as the most common lesion found in PLWHA while Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS) (34.7%) and Oral Hairy Leukoplakia (OHL) (32.6%) were mentioned as the least common oral lesions of HIV. Most correctly identified the images of oral candidiasis (97.8%), angular cheilitis (86.9%) and herpes zoster (80.4%). Only 16.7% felt they had comprehensive knowledge of oral HIV lesions, although 84.8% reported having previously received training. Almost three quarters (71%) reported that there was no need to treat HIV positive patients differently from HIV negative patients. OHCW in Lesotho demonstrated high confidence levels in their competence in managing dental patients with oral lesions associated with HIV, however, they lacked an in-depth knowledge in this regard. Amongst this group there is a need for comprehensive training with regards to diagnosis and management of oral lesions of HIV including the training of other cadres of health care workers together with nurses and community health workers.

The Net Reclassification Index (NRI): a Misleading Measure of Prediction Improvement Even with Independent Test Data Sets.

Pepe MS1, Fan J1, Feng Z2, Gerds T3, Hilden J3.
Author information
Abstract
The Net Reclassification Index (NRI) is a very popular measure for evaluating the improvement in prediction performance gained by adding a marker to a set of baseline predictors. However, the statistical properties of this novel measure have not been explored in depth. We demonstrate the alarming result that the NRI statistic calculated on a large test dataset using risk models derived from a training set is likely to be positive even when the new marker has no predictive information. A related theoretical example is provided in which an incorrect risk function that includes an uninformative marker is proven to erroneously yield a positive NRI. Some insight into this phenomenon is provided. Since large values for the NRI statistic may simply be due to use of poorly fitting risk models, we suggest caution in using the NRI as the basis for marker evaluation. Other measures of prediction performance improvement, such as measures derived from the ROC curve, the net benefit function and the Brier score, cannot be large due to poorly fitting risk functions.

Abstract
BACKGROUND:
Hybrid positron emission tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (PET/MRI) shows high potential for patients with oropharyngeal cancer. Dental implants can cause substantial artifacts in the oral cavity impairing diagnostic accuracy. Therefore, we evaluated new MRI sequences with multi-acquisition variable-resonance image combination (MAVRIC SL) in comparison to conventional high-bandwidth techniques and in a second step showed the effect of artifact size on MRI-based attenuation correction (AC) with a simulation study.
METHODS:
Twenty-five patients with dental implants prospectively underwent a trimodality PET/CT/MRI examination after informed consent was obtained under the approval of the local ethics committee. A conventional 3D gradient-echo sequence (LAVA-Flex) commonly used for MRI-based AC of PET (acquisition time of 14 s), a T1w fast spin-echo sequence with high bandwidth (acquisition time of 3.2 min), as well as MAVRIC SL sequence without and with increased phase acceleration (MAVRIC, acquisition time of 6 min; MAVRIC-fast, acquisition time of 3.5 min) were applied. The absolute and relative reduction of the signal void artifact was calculated for each implant and tested for statistical significance using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The effect of artifact size on PET AC was simulated in one case with a large tumor in the oral cavity. The relative difference of the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) in the tumor was calculated for increasing artifact sizes centered over the second molar.
RESULTS:
The absolute reduction of signal void from LAVA-Flex sequences to the T1-weighted fast spin-echo (FSE) sequences was 416 mm(2) (range 4 to 2,010 mm(2)) to MAVRIC 481 mm(2) (range 12 to 2,288 mm(2)) and to MAVRIC-fast 486 mm(2) (range 39 to 2,209 mm(2)). The relative reduction in signal void was significantly improved for both MAVRIC and MAVRIC-fast compared to T1 FSE (-75%/-78% vs. -62%, p < 0.001 for both). The relative error for SUVmax was negligible for artifacts of 0.5-cm diameter (-0.1%), but substantial for artifacts of 5.2-cm diameter (-33%).
CONCLUSIONS:
MAVRIC-fast could become useful for artifact reduction in PET/MR for patients with dental implants. This might improve diagnostic accuracy especially for patients with tumors in the oropharynx and substantially improve accuracy of PET quantification.

Abstract
BACKGROUND:
The goal of this prospective study was to estimate the absorbed (radiation) doses to salivary glands in radioiodine therapy of thyroid cancer under chewing-gum stimulation using (124)I positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) imaging.
METHODS:
Duplex ultrasonography was conducted in three test persons for visual comparison of the glandular blood flow with three different stimulation types (no stimulation, chewing tasteless gum base, sucking on lemon slices). Ten patients with newly diagnosed differentiated thyroid cancer received (124)I PET/CT dosimetry after thyroidectomy and prior to radioiodine therapy. Patients underwent a series of three (124)I PET/CT scans (4, 24, and ≥96 h after administration of 23 MBq (124)I). They were instructed to chew gum base (tasteless) approximately 20 min after ingesting the (124)I-containing capsule in the course of the first day. Absorbed doses per administered (131)I activity to the salivary glands were calculated and compared with the previously published results of the lemon-juice stimulation and non-stimulation groups.
RESULTS:
The sonograms in the three test persons showed that glandular blood perfusion by lemon-juice stimulation was clearly increased compared with non-stimulation or chewing of gum base. The sonogram comparison between the chewing-gum stimulation and non-stimulation demonstrated a minor increase of blood flow for the gum base-stimulated salivary glands. The mean ± standard deviation of the absorbed dose per activity under chewing-gum stimulation for the submandibular and parotid glands (within parentheses) was 0.22 ± 0.09 Gy/GBq (0.22 ± 0.08 Gy/GBq). Compared with the absorbed doses of the non-stimulation group, 0.24 ± 0.08 Gy/GBq (0.21 ± 0.05 Gy/GBq), those of the chewing-gum stimulation group showed no significant change (P > 0.60), but the absorbed doses of the lemon-juice stimulation group, 0.35 ± 0.14 Gy/GBq (0.33 ± 0.09 Gy/GBq), were significantly higher (P < 0.04) than those of the chewing-gum stimulation group.
CONCLUSIONS:
The results suggest that salivary flow induced by chewing gum base does not cause a significant reduction of the salivary gland absorbed dose compared with that in the non-stimulation group. The increased blood flow appears to be a decisive factor causing the increased (131)I absorbed doses in the lemon-juice stimulation group.

Impact of point spread function modelling and time of flight on FDG uptake measurements in lung lesions using alternative filtering strategies.

Abstract
BACKGROUND:
The use of maximum standardised uptake value (SUVmax) is commonplace in oncology positron emission tomography (PET). Point spread function (PSF) modelling and time-of-flight (TOF) reconstructions have a significant impact on SUVmax, presenting a challenge for centres with defined protocols for lesion classification based on SUVmax thresholds. This has perhaps led to the slow adoption of these reconstructions. This work evaluated the impact of PSF and/or TOF reconstructions on SUVmax, SUVpeak and total lesion glycolysis (TLG) under two different schemes of post-filtering.
METHODS:
Post-filters to match voxel variance or SUVmax were determined using a NEMA NU-2 phantom. Images from 68 consecutive lung cancer patients were reconstructed with the standard iterative algorithm along with TOF; PSF modelling - Siemens HD·PET (HD); and combined PSF modelling and TOF - Siemens ultraHD·PET (UHD) with the two post-filter sets. SUVmax, SUVpeak, TLG and signal-to-noise ratio of tumour relative to liver (SNR(T-L)) were measured in 74 lesions for each reconstruction. Relative differences in uptake measures were calculated, and the clinical impact of any changes was assessed using published guidelines and local practice.
RESULTS:
When matching voxel variance, SUVmax increased substantially (mean increase +32% and +49% for HD and UHD, respectively), potentially impacting outcome in the majority of patients. Increases in SUVpeak were less notable (mean increase +17% and +23% for HD and UHD, respectively). Increases with TOF alone were far less for both measures. Mean changes to TLG were <10% for all algorithms for either set of post-filters. SNR(T-L) were greater than ordered subset expectation maximisation (OSEM) in all reconstructions using both post-filtering sets.
CONCLUSIONS:
Matching image voxel variance with PSF and/or TOF reconstructions, particularly with PSF modelling and in small lesions, resulted in considerable increases in SUVmax, inhibiting the use of defined protocols for lesion classification based on SUVmax. However, reduced partial volume effects may increase lesion detectability. Matching SUVmax in phantoms translated well to patient studies for PSF reconstruction but less well with TOF, where a small positive bias was observed in patient images. Matching SUVmax significantly reduced voxel variance and potential variability of uptake measures. Finally, TLG may be less sensitive to reconstruction methods compared with either SUVmax or SUVpeak.

Abstract
BACKGROUND:
F18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET) reconstruction algorithms can have substantial influence on quantitative image data used, e.g., for therapy planning or monitoring in oncology. We analyzed radial activity concentration profiles of differently reconstructed FDG-PET images to determine the influence of varying signal-to-background ratios (SBRs) on the respective spatial resolution, activity concentration distribution, and quantification (standardized uptake value [SUV], metabolic tumor volume [MTV]).
METHODS:
Measurements were performed on a Siemens Biograph mCT 64 using a cylindrical phantom containing four spheres (diameter, 30 to 70 mm) filled with F18-FDG applying three SBRs (SBR1, 16:1; SBR2, 6:1; SBR3, 2:1). Images were reconstructed employing six algorithms (filtered backprojection [FBP], FBP + time-of-flight analysis [FBP + TOF], 3D-ordered subset expectation maximization [3D-OSEM], 3D-OSEM + TOF, point spread function [PSF], PSF + TOF). Spatial resolution was determined by fitting the convolution of the object geometry with a Gaussian point spread function to radial activity concentration profiles. MTV delineation was performed using fixed thresholds and semiautomatic background-adapted thresholding (ROVER, ABX, Radeberg, Germany).
RESULTS:
The pairwise Wilcoxon test revealed significantly higher spatial resolutions for PSF + TOF (up to 4.0 mm) compared to PSF, FBP, FBP + TOF, 3D-OSEM, and 3D-OSEM + TOF at all SBRs (each P < 0.05) with the highest differences for SBR1 decreasing to the lowest for SBR3. Edge elevations in radial activity profiles (Gibbs artifacts) were highest for PSF and PSF + TOF declining with decreasing SBR (PSF + TOF largest sphere; SBR1, 6.3%; SBR3, 2.7%). These artifacts induce substantial SUVmax overestimation compared to the reference SUV for PSF algorithms at SBR1 and SBR2 leading to substantial MTV underestimation in threshold-based segmentation. In contrast, both PSF algorithms provided the lowest deviation of SUVmean from reference SUV at SBR1 and SBR2.
CONCLUSIONS:
At high contrast, the PSF algorithms provided the highest spatial resolution and lowest SUVmean deviation from the reference SUV. In contrast, both algorithms showed the highest deviations in SUVmax and threshold-based MTV definition. At low contrast, all investigated reconstruction algorithms performed approximately equally. The use of PSF algorithms for quantitative PET data, e.g., for target volume definition or in serial PET studies, should be performed with caution - especially if comparing SUV of lesions with high and low contrasts.

New prospects for PET in prostate cancer imaging: a physicist's viewpoint.

Conti M1.

Abstract
Prostate cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer among men. Early diagnosis, correct staging, accurate detection of metastasis, and monitoring of the therapy are the key tasks that could greatly benefit from medical imaging. After a review of the main developments in the field of positron emission tomography (PET) tracers for prostate cancer, the impact of improved PET instrumentation with good spatial resolution and high sensitivity is discussed, together with the latest development in PET technology: lutetium oxy-ortho-silicate (LSO) and lutetium-yttrium oxy-ortho-silicate (LYSO) scintillators, resolution recovery, and time-of-flight reconstruction. New directions and multiple approaches in PET instrumentation for prostate cancer are presented and discussed. In particular, improved hardware and noise suppressing reconstruction algorithms allow for higher detectability of small lesions and better spatial resolution in PET/computerized tomography (CT) and PET/magnetic resonance (MR). This can be beneficial for guiding biopsy and surgery and for accurate therapy monitoring.

Erratum to: Effective dose to adult patients from 338 radiopharmaceuticals estimated using ICRP biokinetic data, ICRP/ICRU computational reference phantoms and ICRP 2007 tissue weighting factors. [EJNMMI Phys. 2015]
Abstract
BACKGROUND:
Effective dose represents the potential risk to a population of stochastic effects of ionizing radiation (mainly lethal cancer). In recent years, there have been a number of revisions and updates influencing the way to estimate the effective dose. The aim of this work was to recalculate the effective dose values for the 338 different radiopharmaceuticals previously published by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP).
METHOD:
The new estimations are based on information on the cumulated activities per unit administered activity in various organs and tissues and for the various radiopharmaceuticals obtained from the ICRP publications 53, 80 and 106. The effective dose for adults was calculated using the new ICRP/International Commission on Radiation Units (ICRU) reference voxel phantoms and decay data from the ICRP publication 107. The ICRP human alimentary tract model has also been applied at the recalculations. The effective dose was calculated using the new tissue weighting factors from ICRP publications 103 and the prior factors from ICRP publication 60. The results of the new calculations were compared with the effective dose values published by the ICRP, which were generated with the Medical Internal Radiation Dose (MIRD) adult phantom and the tissue weighting factors from ICRP publication 60.
RESULTS:
For 79% of the radiopharmaceuticals, the new calculations gave a lower effective dose per unit administered activity than earlier estimated. As a mean for all radiopharmaceuticals, the effective dose was 25% lower. The use of the new adult computational voxel phantoms has a larger impact on the change of effective doses than the change to new tissue weighting factors.
CONCLUSION:
The use of the new computational voxel phantoms and the new weighting factors has generated new effective dose estimations. These are supposed to result in more realistic estimations of the radiation risk to a population undergoing nuclear medicine investigations than hitherto available values.

A Bayesian Nonparametric Approach for the Analysis of Multiple Categorical Item Responses.

Author information
Abstract
We develop a modeling framework for joint factor and cluster analysis of datasets where multiple categorical response items are collected on a heterogeneous population of individuals. We introduce a latent factor multinomial probit model and employ prior constructions that allow inference on the number of factors as well as clustering of the subjects into homogenous groups according to their relevant factors. Clustering, in particular, allows us to borrow strength across subjects, therefore helping in the estimation of the model parameters, particularly when the number of observations is small. We employ Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques and obtain tractable posterior inference for our objectives, including sampling of missing data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on simulated data. We also analyze two real-world educational datasets and show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods. In the analysis of the real-world data, we uncover hidden relationships between the questions and the underlying educational concepts, while simultaneously partitioning the students into groups of similar educational mastery.

Ameliorative effect of butylated hydroxyanisole against ferric nitrilotriacetate-induced hepatotoxicity and oxidative stress in rats.

Ansar S1, Iqbal M2.
Author information
Abstract
Ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA) is a known renal carcinogen and has been shown to adversely induce oxidative stress and tissue toxicity after both acute and chronic exposure. Present studies were designed to study the hepatoprotective and antioxidant potential of butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), a phenolic antioxidant used in foods on ferric nitrilotriacetate (Fe-NTA) induced hepatotoxicity in rats. Male albino rats of Wistar strain (4-6 weeks old) weighing 125-150 g were used in this study. Animals were given a single dose of Fe-NTA (9 mg/kg body weight, intraperitoneal) after a week's treatment with BHA. BHA was administered orally once daily for 7 days at doses of 1 and 2 mg/animal/day. The hepatoprotective activity was assessed using various biochemical parameters as serum transaminases (alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST)) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Fe-NTA treatment increased ALT, AST, and LDH levels significantly when compared to the corresponding saline-treated group (p < 0.001). Fe-NTA also depleted the levels of glutathione and the activities of antioxidant enzymes namely glutathione reductase and glutathione-S-tranferase (p < 0.05). Pretreatment with BHA significantly decreased ALT, AST and LDH levels in a dose-dependent manner (p < 0.05). BHA also increased antioxidant enzymes level and decreased lipid peroxidation and hydrogen peroxide generation to 1.3-1.5-fold as compared to Fe-NTA-treated group. The results show the strong hepatoprotective activity of BHA which could be due to its potent antioxidant effects.

Addition of Cladribine to Idarubicin and Cytarabine during Induction Increases the Overall Efficacy Rate in Adult Patients with Acute Myeloid Leukemia: A Matched-Pair Retrospective Comparison.

Shen Y1, Chen J, Liu Y, Wu D.
Author information
Abstract
OBJECTIVES:
The aims of this study were to evaluate a novel induction regimen composed of idarubicin (IDA), cytarabine (Ara-C) and cladribine (IAC regimen) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients, and to identify the prognostic factors affecting treatment outcomes.
METHODS:
The clinical data of 27 untreated AML patients who received the IAC regimen as primary induction therapy in our hospital between April and November 2014 were analyzed retrospectively. The treatment outcomes of the IAC regimen were compared with two IA (IDA + Ara-C) regimens (IDA 10 mg/m² and IDA 12 mg/m²) in a pair-matched analysis.
RESULTS:
The complete remission (CR) rate in the IAC arm was higher compared to the IA(L) arm (p = 0.002) as was the overall efficacy rate (p = 0.017). There was no significant difference in outcomes between the IAC and IA(H) (Ara-C with high-dose IDA) arms. The IAC arm contained significantly higher CR rates than the IA(L) (Ara-C with low-dose IDA) arm in both the intermediate group (p = 0.050) and the unfavorable group (p = 0.013). Toxicity did not differ between the IAC group and the other two arms. High WBC at diagnosis (p = 0.022) and an unfavorable karyotype (p = 0.026) were related to a poorer response. The IAC regimen (p = 0.013) had greater superiority over the IAL regimen on efficacy than over the IA(H) regimen (p = 0.041).
CONCLUSIONS:
The IAC regimen achieved a more significant advantage over the IA(L) regimen without increasing the risk of adverse events. The efficacy of induction therapy is associated with WBC at diagnosis, karyotype and induction regimen.

Carboplatin and Etoposide in Heavily Pretreated Patients with Progressive High-Grade Glioma.

Tonder M1, Weller M, Eisele G, Roth P.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:
Treatment of recurrent anaplastic glioma and glioblastoma remains a particular challenge in neurooncology. The lack of controlled trials results in poor evidence for all therapeutic options. Upon recurrence, many patients are treated with bevacizumab or one of the frequently used nitrosoureas such as lomustine. However, patients who still present in overall good condition after failure of multiple lines of therapy may ask for additional therapy.
METHODS:
Here, we report our experience with the use of carboplatin in combination with etoposide as fourth- or fifth-line therapy in patients with progressive high-grade glioma.
RESULTS:
The median Karnofsky performance status at the beginning of treatment was 80%. The median progression-free survival (PFS) was 2.5 months. PFS at 6 months was 0%. Administration of carboplatin and etoposide was associated with grade 3 or 4 hematotoxicity in 8 of 12 patients.
CONCLUSION:
Carboplatin in combination with etoposide has an unfavorable risk-benefit profile in heavily pretreated glioma patients.

Abstract
OBJECTIVES:
Excellent local-regional control can be achieved for major salivary gland tumors treated with surgery and post-operative radiotherapy. We evaluated the cumulative incidence and predictors of distant metastasis in high-risk major salivary gland tumors.
METHODS:
Between 1990 and 2011, 200 patients with major salivary gland tumors received post-operative radiotherapy at our center. The patients' median age was 60 years. Patients had primary tumors of the parotid gland (84%), submandibular (16%), and one sublingual gland. Among the patients, 34% had T3-T4 tumors, 32% had nodal involvement. Other high-risk features included close/positive margins and high grade tumors. The median RT dose was 63 Gy.
RESULTS:
With a median follow-up of 50 months, the 5-year local control and regional control were 88% and 94%, respectively. The 5-year freedom from distant metastasis was 73%. The median overall survival was 14.6 years corresponding to a 5 and 10-year overall survival of 77% and 59%, respectively. T category and nodal involvement were independent predictors of distant metastasis. Nodal involvement was also an independent predictor of overall survival.
CONCLUSIONS:
Distant relapse was the predominant mode of failure despite excellent local-regional control in high-risk major salivary gland tumors. Both advanced T category and nodal involvement were independent predictors of distant metastasis. More effective systemic therapy is needed to combat distant relapse.

Energy transfer between a biological labelling dye and gold nanorods.

Racknor C1, Singh MR, Zhang Y, Birch DJS, Chen Y.
Author information
Abstract
We have demonstrated energy transfer between a biological labelling dye (Alexa Fluor 405) and gold nanorods experimentally and theoretically. The fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy and density matrix method are used to study a hybrid system of dye and nanorods under one- and two-photon excitations. Energy transfer between dye and nanorods via the dipole-dipole interaction is found to cause a decrease in the fluorescence lifetime change. Enhanced energy transfer from dye to nanorods is measured in the presence of an increased density of nanorods. This study has potential applications in fluorescence lifetime-based intra-cellular sensing of bio-analytes as well as nuclear targeting cancer therapy.

High-Grade Primary Spindle Cell Sarcoma of the Prostate: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.

Ozturk H1, Sivrikoz ON2.
Author information
Abstract
Evaluation of the primary spindle cell sarcoma prostate, which is seen extremely rare, is aimed. Literature search was made through a search in the MedLine database using PubMed and Scopus for the articles published between January 1988 and September 2013. Electronic search was limited to the following keywords: "spindle cell sarcoma", "primary prostate sarcoma". Primary prosatate sarcoma was reported as 100 patients in literature. High-grade primary spindle cell sarcoma of the prostate was encountered as 16 patients in literature. This patients was reported as the 17th case. It is a difficult cancer due to diagnosis and treatment because of the short average life expectancy, high potential of asymptomatic aggressive and metastatic. Histopatogenesis is not exactly known. In 50% of composed of patients who are previously diagnosed with prostate adenocarcinom. The case was reported as high-grade primary prosatate sarcoma at an early age. The case is different from other cases because of not being adenocarcinom component.

Metaplastic Breast Carcinoma in the Lungs: A Case Report.

Bourdeanu L1, Somlo G2.
Author information
Abstract
Metaplastic carcinoma of the breast is a rare, aggressive form of cancer occurring in less than 1% of all breast cancers. Spindle cell carcinoma is a rare variant of the metaplastic carcinoma seen in less than 10% of such cases. The prognosis of spindle cell breast cancers is poor, hence aggressive treatment with surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiation is required. Here we report a case of a 62-year-old female with metastatic metaplastic breast cancer to the lungs.

Abstract
Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) is associated with an increased risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) occurring predominantly in patients with cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis. However, HCC in non-cirrhotic liver of patients with secondary hemochromatosis is rare. A 67-year-old man with a history of myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) was found to have a liver tumor on abdominal computed tomography (CT). On the basis of findings of high levels of serum ferritin and transferrin saturation, and low intensity of liver parenchyma on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), we made a diagnosis of hemochromatosis. Liver resection was performed and the specimen showed moderately differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma surrounded by non-cirrhotic liver parenchyma with intracellular iron deposition. Multicentric recurrence of liver tumor occurred 2 years after the surgery despite of deferoxamine therapy with well controlled ferritin level. We reported a case of hepatocellular carcinoma in a non-cirrhotic patient with liver iron overload secondary to MDS. It demonstrated the importance of early detection and initiation of treatment of iron overload in preventing HCC in MDS patients, even among Asian population.

TNBC vs. Non-TNBC: A Five-Year Retrospective Review of Differences in Mean Age, Family History, Smoking History and Stage at Diagnosis at an Inner City University Program.

Tariq K1, Rana F2.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:
In recent years, breast cancer has been classified on the basis of estrogen or progesterone receptor (ER/PR) status and whether the human epidermal growth factor 2 receptor (HER2/neu) protein is overexpressed. Based on this system, breast cancer is broadly divided into the triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) and the non-TNBC subtypes. TNBC is a subtype of breast cancer, notable for its propensity to metastasize early and display a comparatively more aggressive course than its non-TNBC counterpart. Certain clinico-pathologic and demographic risk factors have been associated with breast cancer. In this study, we aim to compare mean age, ethnicity, family history, tobacco use and stage at presentation between TNBC and non-TNBC subtypes at our inner city university program.
METHODS:
We reviewed data in our tumor registry between January 2000 and December 2005 with particular attention to mean age, race, family history, tobacco use and stage at presentation. We found a total of 445 patients with various subtypes of breast cancers. We included only those patients in whom the status of both ER/PR and the status of Her2/neu protein overexpression were recorded. Our strict selection criteria lead to an exclusion of about 103 patients. Out of the remaining 342 patients, 39 were TNBC and 303 were non-TNBC.
RESULTS:
Mean age of onset for TNBC vs. non-TNBC patients was 59.87 ± 15.67 years vs. 60.09 ± 13.98 years respectively (P = 0.9272). In terms of ethnicity, TNBC vs. non-TNBC patients had the following racial backgrounds: black, 58.97% vs. 39.27%; white, 35.90% vs. 57.76%; Chinese, 2.56% vs. 0.99%; others, 2.57% vs. 1.98% respectively (P = 0.004, OR = 2.755). Comparisons with respect to a history of tobacco abuse for TNBC vs. non-TNBC patients revealed a positive smoking history in 20.51% vs. 27.72% whereas there was no former or current smoking history in 71.79% vs. 61.72% respectively (P = 0.4385). Comparison of family history of a breast cancer in TNBC vs. non-TNBC patients showed that positive family history of breast cancer was seen in 30.77% vs. 33.33%, no family history of cancer was seen in 51.28% vs. 51.82% and unknown 17.95% vs. 14.85% (P = 0.8384). Pathologic stage at the time of diagnosis for TNBC vs. non-TNBC patients was as follows: stage 0, 15.79% vs. 11.37% (P = 0.4332); stage 1, 34.21% vs. 30.98% (P = 0.6890); stage 2, 28.98% vs. 37.25% (P = 0.3205); stage 3, 18.42% vs. 17.25% (P = 0.0.8591); and stage 4, 3.63% vs. 3.14% (P = 0.8651). Analysis using Chi-square test revealed χ2 value of 0.855.
CONCLUSION:
Our results add to the growing body of evidence pertaining to the association of certain demographic and clinico-pathologic characteristics in women with breast cancer. We found that in our patient population, there is a significant ethnic predisposition for the two types of breast cancers that we studied. African Americans were more likely to have TNBC compared to the higher frequency of non-TNBC in white females. We did not find a significant difference in mean age, cigarette smoking, family history and stage at diagnosis between the TNBC and non-TNBC breast cancer patients. These findings are all consistent with the previously published research studies.

Api M1, Kayatas S1, Boza AT1, Nazik H2, Adiguzel C2, Guzin K3, Eroglu M1.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:
The aim of the present study was to compare the laparotomy (LT) and laparoscopy (LS) in patients who undergone surgical staging for early stage endometrium cancer.
METHODS:
Retrospective data were collected and analyzed for amount of intraoperative bleeding, complication rates, total resected and laterality specific number of lymph nodes and duration of operation in patients operated with either LT or LS.
RESULTS:
Seventy-nine stage I endometrium cancer patients were found to be eligible for the trial purposes: 58 (73.4%) treated by LT and 21 (26.6%) treated by LS. The number of lymph nodes was similar in LT (8.9 ± 5.3) and LS (9.2 ± 4.8) (P = 0.8). In LT group, there was no difference in the number of lymph nodes between the right and left sides (10 ± 5.8 and 8.7 ± 4.8 respectively, P = 0.19); in LS group, the number of lymph nodes resected from the right side was higher than the left side (9.8 ± 5 and 7 ± 3.5 respectively, P = 0.039). The amount of intraoperative bleeding and hospitalization period were significantly higher in LT group. Seventy-nine patients had a median follow-up of 30 months. The two groups were similar for disease-free survival (P = 0.46, log rank test).
CONCLUSIONS:
There was no significant difference between the two methods in terms of number of total resected lymph nodes. In early stage endometrial carcinoma, LS has provided adequate staging and similar survival rates with LT.

Abstract
BACKGROUND:
The Chernobyl accident caused widespread effects across Europe and huge areas where radiocontaminated. The effects of the Chernobyl accident on thyroid cancer have been investigated in most European countries. According to the data of the Turkish Atomic Energy Authority, the eastern part of the Black Sea region was the most radiocontaminated area in Turkey at the time of Chernobyl accident. We therefore aimed to examine the data of thyroid cancers at our center, Rize city which is located in the eastern Black Sea region.
METHODS:
This retrospective study included the patients with histologically proven thyroid cancer at our center between January 2008 and May 2012. Pathologic examinations of thyroidectomy materials were reviewed. We evaluated patients' age, gender, size of the primary tumor (all sizes, < 1 cm, 1 - 2.9 cm, 3 - 3.9 cm and ≥ 4 cm), multicentricity, histologic subtypes of thyroid cancer, the presence of lymphatic, vascular, capsule and the extrathyroidal invasion.
RESULTS:
Five hundred and forty-seven of the 3,556 patients were diagnosed with thyroid cancer. The mean age of the patients was 49.31 ± 0.49 years. The histopathologic diagnosis of patients was papillary carcinoma in 533 (97.4%) and the tumor size was < 1 cm in 53.6% of the patients. The presence of multicentricity was detected in 47% of the patients.
CONCLUSION:
The portion of thyroid carcinomas in all thyroidectomies was 15.4% in our institution 27 years after the Chernobyl accident.

Abstract
BACKGROUND:
The purpose of this study was to compare the long-term survival of patients with stage IIIB squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix treated with neoadjuvant intraarterial chemotherapy (IA-NAC) versus those treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT).
METHODS:
We retrospectively reviewed the clinical records of 38 patients with stage IIIB squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix admitted between January 1994 and December 1999 who received IA-NAC followed by abdominal radical hysterectomy (ARH) or radiotherapy (RT). IA-NAC consisted of bilateral infusion via the internal iliac artery of cisplatin, bleomycin and pirarubicin for 2-3 courses. A historical control group of 64 patients who underwent primary CCRT from January 2000 to September 2007 was used for comparison.
RESULTS:
In the IA-NAC group, 12 patients (31.6%) with operable tumors underwent ARH, and the remaining 26 patients (68.4%) received RT. The response rates were 86.8% (12 complete response + 21 partial response) for IA-NAC and 98.4% (26 complete response + 37 partial response) for CCRT (P = 0.077), respectively. The 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 62.4 and 44.5% for IA-NAC and 51.1 and 46.9% for CCRT (P = 0.247 and 0.776), respectively. The 5-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 75.0 and 58.3% for the patients receiving IA-NAC followed by ARH, and 55.3 and 37.6% for the patients receiving IA-NAC followed by RT (P = 0.368 and 0.262), respectively.
CONCLUSIONS:
In the present study, IA-NAC followed by ARH or RT and primary CCRT showed similar survival rates for stage IIIB squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix.

A Rare Case of Primary Gastric HIV-Associated Peripheral T-Cell Lymphoma: Relapsed Disease Treated With Pemetrexed.

Gong J1, Delioukina ML2, Hendifar AE3.
Author information
Abstract
We present a case of a patient with HIV/AIDS who presented with abdominal pain and melena and was found to have gastric peripheral T-cell lymphoma (PTCL). He was treated with 6 cycles of EPOCH with a complete response. Within 3 months, he had central nervous system (CNS) and soft-tissue relapse. He was subsequently treated with 3 cycles of intravenous pemetrexed and experienced a second complete response. To our knowledge, there are fewer than 100 reports of HIV-associated PTCL worldwide as of 2010, and among these cases involvement of the stomach as the primary site of extranodal disease is exceptionally rare. The disease carries a poor prognosis and current standard therapies highlight the importance of HIV/AIDS disease control and the need for more studies on therapies and the role of transplantation in refractory or relapsed HIV-associated PTCL.

Successful Use of Erlotinib in Treating Recurrent Thymic Carcinoma: A Case Report.

Brown LA1.
Author information
Abstract
Thymic carcinomas are rare and aggressive tumors. Primary treatment for these tumors consists of surgical resection, followed by adjuvant radiation therapy or platinum based chemotherapy. Unfortunately these tumors often exhibit a high incidence of local recurrence and metastasis despite treatment. Of recent interest are new targeted therapies such as Tarceva® (erlotinib), an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitor, for treatment of recurrent thymic carcinoma. Unfortunately recent literature has shown little success with its use, except for a few isolated case reports. Here we present a unique case of progressive disease despite 4 cycles of cisplatin, doxorubicin, vincristine, and cyclophosphamide (ADOC) therapy, and subsequent treatment with 150mg erlotinib daily resulting in partial response at 6 months with tumor shrinking in size and resolution of many metastatic nodules.

Excellent Response to Palliative Chemotherapy for Pleural Recurrence of Uterine Papillary Serous Carcinoma.

Singh S1, Mack D1, Dookhan D1, Jyotimallika J1.
Author information
Abstract
Uterine papillary serous carcinoma (UPSC) is an aggressive variant of endometrial cancer. Though the majority of women with UPSC have high risk of recurrence, recurrence limited only to the pleural space has not been previously reported. It is also unusual for it to occur as late as 10 years after the initial treatment as it is usually very aggressive. There is scant information in literature on response to treatment in these patients. A 65-year-old African-American woman was treated for FIGO stage IIA UPSC with total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, and pelvic lymphadenectomy with 32P catheter placement, followed by adjuvant external beam radiation. She relapsed 10 years later with right pleural effusion and pleural based nodules. Fluid cytology was consistent with UPSC. She was treated with 6 cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel with excellent clinical and biochemical response. She continues to remain disease free 5 years later. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of UPSC recurrence limited to pleura, and this is also the first reported case of UPSC recurrence without evidence of disease 5 years after palliative chemotherapy.

Management of Metastatic Solid Pseudopapillary Cancer of the Pancreas: A Case Report.

Dixon M1, Cannon J2, Kagedan D3, Rowsell C4, Milot L5, Ko YJ6, Coburn N3.
Author information
Abstract
Solid pseudopapillary tumors (SPT) of the pancreas are rare neoplasms predominantly found in females. The tumors are often histologically benign and patient outcomes are correspondingly favorable. This report presents the case of a 21-year-old woman who presented with metachronous metastatic SPT, and details the diagnosis and management of this patient. The patient underwent a distal pancreatectomy for resection of the primary neoplasm with negative margins. A surveillance ultrasound performed at 43 months post-operatively revealed new hepatic lesions; these lesions were surgically resected and pathologically demonstrated to be metastatic SPT of the pancreas. This case report demonstrates the potential for latent metastasis of resected SPT, imaging characteristics of metastatic disease, the need for surveillance of patients following resection of SPT of the pancreas and a review of relevant literature on SPT.

Female Body Mass Index and its Relationship With Triple Negative Breast Cancer and Ethnicity.

Tariq KB1, Rana F2.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:
Breast cancer in women is a relatively common malignancy in the western hemisphere and is perhaps one of the leading causes of mortality among females. We conducted a retrospect cohort study to investigate the association of body mass index (BMI) with triple negative breast cancer and ethnicity.
METHODS:
Tumor Registry Database at the University of Florida, College of Medicine in Jacksonville was utilized for our cohort study. A total of 84 women with triple negative breast cancer, between 2004 and 2008 met our criteria and were selected for this study. For comparison, another 83 women with at least one hormone receptors positive breast cancer were randomly selected in the same time period. Chi-square testing was used to evaluate categorical variables, while the t-test analysis was used to analyze for the continuous variables.
RESULTS:
Our data demonstrated that 27.4% of the triple negative group had BMI < 25 compared to the 14.5% of non-triple negative breast cancer, 73.6% of the triple negative group had BMI ≥ 25 compared to 86.5% in the non-triple negative group with a P-value of 0.245. In terms of ethnicity, triple negative breast cancer was found in 56% of African-American and 44% of Caucasian females. Non-triple negative breast cancer was found in 48.2% of African-Americans and 51.8% of Caucasians females with a P-value of 0.354.
CONCLUSIONS:
We were not able to show any statistically significant association of body mass index triple with triple negative breast cancer or ethnicity. While our findings are not in agreement with the research published earlier, we do submit that our retrospective cohort study has shortcomings, including the small sample size pooled from a single center, which greatly limits our ability to deduce any definitive conclusions. In light of these shortcomings, we recommend a future multicenter study with a larger sample size.

Abstract
BACKGROUND:
KRAS gene mutations play an important role in the carcinogenesis of colorectal tumors. However, studies that have assessed the association between KRAS gene mutation status and disease characteristics report conflicting results. To assess KRAS gene status (mutated or wild-type) and its association with the clinical, epidemiological, and histopathological features of metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma as well its association with clinical outcomes.
METHODS:
Cross-sectional descriptive study in which clinical and histopathological data were collected from the medical records of 65 patients diagnosed with metastatic colorectal adenocarcinoma at the Clinical Oncology Service of the Teaching Hospital of the School of Medicine of Ribeirao Preto, University of Sao Paulo (Hospital das Clinicas da Faculdade de Medicina de Ribeirao Preto, Universidade de Sao Paulo -HCFMRP-USP) between 2005 and 2012 and analyzed based on their KRAS gene status.
RESULTS:
KRAS gene mutations were found in 49.2% of the tumors, and G/A (25.5%) and Gly12Asp (34.37%) were the most frequent mutations. Among the investigated clinical features (gender, ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group), histology, degree of cell differentiation, lymph node ratio, primary tumor site, staging, presence of synchronous metastasis, lung metastasis, and liver metastasis), the association between age less than 65 years with KRAS mutation was statistically significant (P = 0.046). KRAS mutation status did not exhibit a significant correlation with the overall survival of the patients (P = 0.078); however, the cases with KRAS mutation exhibited shorter survival. In the multivariate analysis, synchronous metastasis (P = 0.03) and liver metastasis (P = 0.008) behaved as independent factors of poor prognosis relative to the overall survival of the patients.
CONCLUSION:
The KRAS mutation status did not exhibit prognostic value in the investigated sample. Among the older patients (> 65 years old), wild-type KRAS was more frequently observed compared to mutated KRAS.

Renal Medullary Carcinoma Masquerading as Bilateral Breast Carcinoma Category: Case Report.

Anne M1, Sammartino D2, Chaudhary S3, Bhuiya T3, Mehrotra B4.
Author information
Abstract
Metastatic disease to the breast accounts for less than 1% of all breast carcinoma. Here we describe an unusual case of a 34-year-old black female with history of sickle cell trait who presented to her gynecologist with bilateral palpable breast masses. Based on initial workup including pathology results from biopsies of both breast masses, she was diagnosed with bilateral breast cancer. However further radiographic imaging revealed a large right kidney mass suspicious for primary renal neoplasm along with lung and bone lesions. This prompted re-review of the initial breast pathology. Sickled erythrocytes were identified and results of an additional immunohistochemical panel revealed positive expression of PAX 8, vimentin, Oct3/4, and loss of INI1, confirming the diagnosis of metastatic renal medullary carcinoma. We discuss the importance of considering renal medullary carcinoma in the differential diagnosis when evaluating young patients with sickle cell hemoglobinopathies who present with aggressive metastatic disease.

Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:
To investigate the nuclear matrix protein NMP22 in voided urine for detection of malignancy in patients with risk factors of symptoms of bladder cancer.
METHODS:
January 2009 to December 2012, participants included 1,331 patients at elevated risk for bladder cancer due to factors such as history of smoking or symptoms including hematuria and dysuria, patients at risk for malignancy of the urinary tract provided a voided urine sample for analysis of NMP22 protein and cytology prior to cystoscopy. The diagnosis of bladder cancer, based on cystoscopy with biopsy, was accepted as the reference standard. The performance of the NMP22 test was compared with voided urine cytology as an aid to cancer detection. Testing for the NMP22 tumor marker was conducted in a blinded manner.
RESULTS:
Bladder cancer was diagnosed in 79 patients. The NMP22 assay was positive in 44 of 79 patients with cancer (sensitivity, 55.7%, 95% confidence interval (CI), 44.1-66.7%), whereas cytology test results were positive in 12 of 76 patients (sensitivity, 15.8%; 95% CI, 7.6-24.0%). The specificity of the NMP22 assay was 85.7% (95% CI, 83.8-87.6%) compared with 99.2% (95% CI, 98 initial endoscopy, including 3 that were muscle invasive and 1 carcinoma in situ.
CONCLUSION:
The noninvasive point-of-care assay for elevated urinary NMP22 protein can increase the accuracy of cytoscopy, with test results available during the patient visit.

Treatment of Active Mucositis With Caphosol (Calcium Phosphate): A Retrospective Case-Series.

Younus J1, Kligman L2, Jawaid MA3, Dhalla A4.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:
Mucositis is a common side effect due to chemo and/radiation therapy. Caphosol has been a proven preventive strategy against mucositis in randomized clinical trials. However, its efficacy to treat active mucositis in patients treated for solid tumors with chemotherapy is unknown. The objective was to evaluate the efficacy of Caphosol to treat mucositis by comparing the grade of mucositis before and after treatment and documenting the duration of treatment.
METHODS:
A retrospective review was conducted on consecutive adult patients at London Regional Cancer Program (LRCP) who developed chemotherapy-induced oral mucositis and were then treated with Caphosol. This study was approved by ethics committee at University of Western Ontario.
RESULTS:
A total of 21 patients, two males (one with cancer esophagus and another with lung cancer) and 19 females (all with breast cancer), with a median age of 59 years were evaluated. Grade 3 mucositis was present in 4 patients who completely resolved with Caphosol in an average of 4 days of treatment, without needing any hospitalization. Fifteen patients with grade 2 mucositis reverted back to grade 0 by using Caphosol for an average of 3.5 days. One patient with no effect had grade 1 mucositis dating prior to treatment with chemotherapy and remained as such. Another patient with no initial improvement had oral candidiasis and once treated with Fluconozole and Caphosol had a complete resolution. No obvious side effects were reported by patients related to the use of Caphosol.
CONCLUSION:
Our case series, for the first time, shows that Caphosol may be used as a potentially effective treatment in patients with solid tumor, who develop chemotherapy-induced mucositis.

Molecular Mechanism and Targeted Therapy Options of Triple-Negative (ER, PgR, HER-2/neu) Breast Cancer: Review.

Kandula M1, Ch KK1, Ys AR1.
Author information
Abstract
Tripple negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for approximately 15% of breast cancers. It is defined by the absence of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER-2 Over expression. Expression of ER, PR and HER-2 plays an important role in therapeutic assessment of patients with breast cancer. TNBC is not one disease, but a family of diseases, some of which are highly aggressive with limited treatment options. Triple-negative breast cancers Patients are not benefiting from currently available receptor-targeted systemic therapy. At present, there is no single agent that targets triple-negative breast cancer. However, researchers are presently investigating large number of potential therapies that may eventually improve outcomes in these patients. In this review article, we discussed about tripple negative breast cancer, also the role of BRCA gene mutations and targeted therapeutic options available to triple negative breast cancer patients.

Abstract
The blood-brain barrier is traditionally regarded as an insurmountable obstacle to the effective drug therapy of brain metastases from solid tumors. Here we describe a striking case of complete radiologic response to chemotherapy, and propose that the critical success factors include the large tumor size, HER2-positivity, and concomitant use of trastuzumab.

Pneumothorax as a Presenting Clinical Manifestation of Metastatic Prostate Cancer.

Chiang KH1,2, Hung SH3, Chang ST4.
Author information
Abstract
Pulmonary metastases are not encountered commonly in patients with prostate cancer. Pulmonary metastases with pneumothorax as a presenting clinical manifestation in newly diagnosed prostate cancer are very rare. Here, we present the case of an 82-year-old patient who was admitted to our center with a chief complaint of worsening dyspnea over the past few days. The chest X-ray and computed tomography (CT) showed left pneumothorax and bilateral lung opacities as well as generalized lymphadenopathy and diffuse bony metastases. After a series of workup including cervical lymph node biopsy with immunohistochemical staining, abdomen CT, serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA), and transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS), he was proved to have prostate cancer with multiple lung, bone and lymph node metastases. This case is reported because of the rarity for a prostate carcinoma presented clinically with an unusual pulmonary manifestation.

Abstract
Colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer related deaths in western world. While most common site for metastasis for colon cancer is liver, lung, and the peritoneum, metastasis to various other organs such as brain, bones and thyroid has been reported. Metastatic lesions to the small bowel are more common than primary lesions and most common primary neoplasms that metastasize to the duodenum are lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, breast cancer, and malignant melanoma. We report a very rare case of recurrent adenocarcinoma of colon metastasizing to duodenum after 2 years of curative resection of primary cancer. Surgical resection for curative intent as well as palliative management is recommended.

The Relationship Between Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness and Glycemic Levels in Patients Submitted to Radical Prostatectomy.

Goncalves SC1, de Moraes Siqueira R2, Nogueira MVF2, Pereira-Correia JA2, Vaz FP2, Peres WAF1.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:
The relationship between hyperglycemia and prostate cancer remains controversial. According to current hypotheses, elevated serum glucose levels may lead to disease development or disease prevention. Our study examined the potential correlation between pre-operative glycemic levels of patients with prostate cancer and the grade of tumor aggressiveness.
METHOD:
We studied the case files of patients with a diagnosis of prostate cancer who had received putatively curative cancer surgery at the Urology Department of the Servidores do Estado Federal Hospital (RJ/Brazil). We transcribed information related to glycemia - collected up to 3 months before the surgery - and the histopathological grade of tumor aggressiveness (Gleason score) of the surgically removed prostates.
RESULTS:
We analyzed 42 people who met the inclusion criteria. Based on Gleason scores, among the normoglycemic patients, we detected low, moderate, and highly aggressive neoplasias in 13%, 53%, and 36% of the cases, respectively. For the hyperglycemic group, these rates were 30%, 60%, and 10%, respectively. Normoglycemic patients had primary Gleason grade 3 in 40% of the cases and grade 4 in 60% of the cases. For the hyperglycemic patients, these rates were 90% and 10%, respectively (P < 0.05 vs. grade 3 group).
CONCLUSION:
Both Gleason score and primary Gleason grade were lower in hyperglycemic patients with prostate cancer than in normoglycemic patients, suggesting a "protective action" of hyperglycemic states.

Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Blood Levels as Indicator for the Efficacy of Cancer Treatment.

El-Akawi ZJ1, Abu-Awad AM2, Khouri NA3.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:
Alpha-1 antitrypsin (α1-AT) is a member of the serine protease inhibitors (serpins) family. Liver cells are the major source of synthesis and secretion of (α1-AT) into the blood. Moreover, it has been demonstrated that α1-AT is expressed and secreted by many types of malignant cells. Studies have indicated that serum levels of (α1-AT) increase in a good number of malignant diseases. In addition, a significant correlation between serum levels and cancer stage has also been reported. In this work we aimed to test how α1-AT levels behave at the third week after treatment with chemotherapy.
METHODS:
The α1-AT blood levels were measured using commercially available radial immunodiffusion kit (Kent Laboratory Inc, Bellinham, Washigton) following manufacturer instructions.
RESULTS:
The α1-AT blood levels were significantly decreased after treatment compared with those before the treatment started. The mean difference (before - after) treatment was 127.82 and 137.37 mg/dL with 95% CI of difference 109.06 - 146.57 and 116.08 - 158.65 mg/dL in lung and prostate cancer respectively. When we compared these levels according to the stage of cancer, we found that the mean difference (before - after) treatment was also highly significant as indicated by P-value and the 95% CI of these differences.
CONCLUSION:
Obtained data strongly indicate the value of testing α1-AT blood levels as one of the important indicators for the efficacy of cancer treatment.

Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:
The extent of vascular invasion is a key factor determining the resectability of non-metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. The purpose of this study is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of computed tomography (CT), endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the pre-operative evaluation of vascular invasion in pancreatic adenocarcinoma, with surgery as the reference standard.
METHODS:
A search of the MEDLINE database for relevant articles in the English language published between January 2000 and February 2009 was performed. From each study, 2 × 2 tables were obtained, and pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratios, negative likelihood ratios and diagnostic odds ratios were calculated for each modality, along with a summary receiver operating characteristics (SROC) curve.
RESULTS:
16 studies with a total of 797 patients who had surgical assessment of vascular invasion were included in the analysis. Several studies evaluated more than one imaging modality, allowing 24 datasets to be obtained in total. Sensitivity was highest for CT (0.73, 95% CI 0.67 - 0.79), followed by EUS (0.66, 95% CI 0.56 - 0.75) and MRI (0.63, 95% CI 0.48 - 0.77). The specificity for all three imaging modalities was comparable. The diagnostic odds ratios for CT, EUS and MRI were 45.9 (95% CI 18.0 - 117.4), 23.0 (95%CI 9.4 - 56.6), 23.9 (95% CI 5.4 - 105.1) respectively.
CONCLUSION:
CT was more accurate than EUS and MRI in the evaluation of vascular invasion in pancreatic adenocarcinoma and should be the first line investigation in pre-operative staging.

An Update on the Quality of Life Measurements in Lung Cancer Patients Receiving Palliative Radiotherapy: A Literature Review.

Chu D1, Nguyen J1, Koo K1, Zeng L1, Bedard G1, Lam H1, Wong E1, Popovic M1, Chow E1.
Author information
Abstract
To conduct a systematic review on validated instruments used to assess quality of life (QOL) in patients with either primary or metastatic lung neoplasms. A literature search was conducted through the Embase (1950 - 2012 week 30) and Medline (1946 - 2012 week 3 July) databases. All compiled studies utilized QOL or symptom palliation as a primary or secondary outcome for patients with advanced lung cancer. A total of 17 studies met our criteria. Four questionnaires were most commonly used: the EORTC QLQ-C-30, the EORTC QLQ-LC-13, the Rotterdam Symptom Check-list (RSCL), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). The limited number of studies assessing QOL in patients with advanced lung cancer suggests that QOL is still an uncommon endpoint for this patient population. Nine of seventeen (53%) studies evaluated QOL in their cohorts and out of those nine, seven (77%) included the use of a lung-specific tool. In total there were eleven of seventeen (65%) studies that evaluated symptom palliation, indicating the relevance of symptom palliation as an endpoint in this population. It is encouraged that lung specific QOL questionnaires, such as the FACT-L and the EORTC QLQ LC-13, be used in tandem with general questionnaires, such as the FACT-G and the EORTC QLQ C-30, in advanced lung cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. Clinicians should also be advised to focus more on QOL assessment.

Primary Testicular Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma: A Case Report.

Guner SI1, Karacetin D2, Yuksel M3.
Author information
Abstract
Testicular lymphoma was first reported by Malassez and Curling in 1866. Primary testicular lymphoma constitutes only 1-7% of all testicular neoplasms and less than 1% of all non Hodgkin lymphoma. We report the case of a 47-year-old man without a particular past medical history, who presented with a painful left testicular swelling that he has noticed for several weeks. Radiological findings consisted in multiple hypoechoic masses that corresponded in histological examination to a diffuse intratubular lymphomatous infiltration situated away from the spermatic cord, the epididymis, ductuli efferentes and rete testis. Immunohistochemical study showed positivity of MUM-1, Bcl-2 and B-cell marker (CD20) and TdT, CD 3, CD5, Bcl-1, CD10, Bcl-6 and Myeloperoksidaz were negative. Ki-67 proliferation index was 90% of neoplastic lenfoid infiltration. The patient underwent full staging for lymphoma by positron emission tomography, showing right superior paratrakeal, precarinal, subcarinal, left paraaortic and retrocrural and left iliac involvement lymph nodes also the right testis and of extra-testicular involvement by the skeleton sistem. The diagnosis of stage III primary testicular large B-cell lymphoma of germinal center B-cell-like group was made. The patient is now treated by chemotherapy. Primary testicular lymphoma is a rare tumor whose diagnosis is based on histological findings. There are non consensual etiological or predisposing factors. Treatment modalities consist in surgical excision, chemotherapy and radiation therapy but the accurate procedures are not standardized. Factors that have been linked to more favorable outcomes include younger patient age, localized disease, presence of sclerosis at pathologic analysis, smaller tumor size, lower histological tumor grade and lack of epididymal or spermatic cord involvement.

A Case of Complete Response to Letrozol Treatment in a Postmenopausal Woman With Breast Cancer Who has Progressed After Multiple Lines of Chemotherapy.

Tural D1, Akar E2, Sager S3, Yildiz O1, Ozguroglu M1.
Author information
Abstract
Approximately 60% of all breast cancers are endocrine dependent. Postmenopausal patients who have positive hormone receptor status are eligible for aromatase inhibitor treatment. Letrozole is a potent, selective, non-steroidal, third-generation aromatase inhibitor which reduces oestrogen biosynthesis approximately 99% at the dose of 2.5 mg/day. We report a 54-years-old female patient diagnosed with grade 2 invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. She received adjuvant chemotherapy, followed by 5 years of tamoxifen. After 8 years, recurrence appeared in lung, supraclavicular lymph nodes and brain. She had many cycles of cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents, trastuzumab and lapatinib previously. After the progression (lung and brain), palliative therapy was thought due to very poor performance status of the patient. (ECOG: 3) Letrozole was added in the treatment and we obtained near-complete remission from her lung and brain metastasis with 2.5 mg/day dose of letrozole. This study might support successfully use of aromatase inhibitors in patients who has been previously treated with multiple lines of chemotherapy and had still progressive disease.

Abstract
Renal cell carcinoma is a rare cancer in Thailand. Most of the patients present in advanced metastatic stage with identifiable renal mass. In this case report, we presents a case of male patient who manifested with supraclavicular lymph node enlargement and CT scan of chest and abdomen showed multiple sites lymph node metastasis but there was no primary mass detected anywhere. The pathology of supraclavicular lymph node was papillary cell adenocarcinoma. The differential diagnoses were papillary thyroid cancer, gastrointestinal tract carcinoma such as pancreato-biliary cancer, non small cell lung cancer, and renal cancer. Immunohistochemistry result were negative for TTF-1, Thyroglobulin, CD7 and CD20 which ruled out non-small cell lung adenocarcinoma, thyroid cancer and gastrointestinal tract cancer respectively. CD10, Vimentin and RCC were all positive and all are specific for renal cell carcinoma. The diagnosis was renal cell carcinoma, papillary cell type. Sunitinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is the treatment of choice for renal cell carcinoma since it improves objective response rate and shows longer progression free survival than IFNα.

Complete Response of Para-Aortic and Lateral Pelvic Lymph Node Recurrence of Rectal Cancer Treated to S-1 Monotherapy.

Miyazawa T1, Koide N1, Fujita N1.
Author information
Abstract
This report presents a case of para-aortic and lateral pelvic lymph node recurrence of rectal cancer that showed complete response to S-1 monotherapy. A 69-year-old man underwent low anterior resection for rectal cancer in 2007. Para-aortic lymph and right lateral pelvic lymph node recurrence occurred in 2008. He received a fluorouracil/folinic acid plus oxaliplatin regimen; however, G4 neutropenia and G3 fatigue were experienced. We started S-1 monotherapy as a salvage treatment. Abdominal computed tomography did not reveal any para-aortic and lateral pelvic lymph nodes recurrence after 10 cycles of S-1 monotherapy. Hence, response in this case was classified as a complete response. No recurrence was noted 36 months after the complete response. S-1 monotherapy is likely to be effective in treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who do not respond to standard combination chemotherapy.

Outcome Improvement in RPA I or II Patients With 1 or 2 Brain Metastases by Combined Surgery and Radiotherapy.

Antoni D1, Kehrli P2, Clavier JB1, Lahlou MA1,2, Lefebvre F3, Noel G1.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:
To evaluate the role of surgery and postoperative radiotherapy in the management of brain metastases (BM): a retrospective analysis for overall survival (OS), local and brain control (LC and BC) of a series of 329 patients with recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) I or II with 1 or 2 BM in a single institution.
METHODS:
Patients were treated either with combined surgical resection and whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) in 104 cases (31.6%) or with WBRT alone in 225 cases (68.4%). Ninety-five patients (91.4%) who underwent surgery and WBRT and 147 (65.3%) who underwent WBRT alone benefited from a radiation boost to the metastatic site.
RESULTS:
The median OS was higher for patients RPA I compared to RPA II: 21.3 and 5.9 months (P < 0.0001), as well as for the surgical group compared to the radiation group: 20.2 vs 5.3 months (P < 0.0001), respectively. After the multivariate analysis, the improved OS was significantly associated with control of primary tumor (P = 0.0002) after surgical resection and with type of primary tumor (P = 0.002), absence of extracranial metastases (ECM) (P = 0.006), and high Karnofsky performance status (90 - 100 vs 70 - 80) (P = 0.003) after radiotherapy alone. The 12-, 24- and 36-months LC rates were 91.1%, 91.1% and 83.9%, respectively, after surgical resection and 81.2%, 63.1% and 57.3%, respectively, after radiotherapy alone (P = 0.005). In a univariate analysis, improved LC for the surgical group was also associated with the absence of ECM (P = 0.01) and for the radiation group, with a radiation boost (P = 0.01). The BC rates at 12, 24 and 36 months were 73.2%, 66.9% and 56%, respectively, in the surgical group and 75.7%, 49.6% and 42.4%, respectively, in the radiation group (P = 0.2). In our univariate analysis, improved BC after surgical resection was associated with control of primary tumor (P = 0.02). For patients in the radiation group, gender (P = 0.03) and a radiation boost (P = 0.0003) were significant prognostic factors in a univariate analysis. In our multivariate analysis, only the radiation boost was significant (P = 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS:
Surgical resection followed by WBRT leads to a better outcome compared to WBRT alone for RPA I or II patients with 1 or 2 BM.

Cardiotoxicity After Anthracycline Treatment in Survivors of Adult Cancers: Monitoring by USCOM, Echocardiography and Serum Biomarkers.

Pastore A1, Geiger S1, Baur D1, Hausmann A1, Tischer J1, Horster S2, Stemmler HJ1.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:
Anthracyclines are agents with a well known documented anti-tumoral activity. Cardiac side effects are the principal toxicity. Here we evaluate and monitor the onset of late anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity with real-time CW-Doppler ultrasound cardiac output monitoring (USCOM®) and echocardiography in combination with serum biomarkers.
METHODS:
Fifty-two patients without cardiac disease who had received an anthracycline-based regimen for various cancer types were included in this study. Patients' hemodynamic parameters as stroke volume (SV USCOM (mL)) and ejection fraction (EF ECHOCARDIOGRAPHY (%)) were measured with USCOM and echocardiography and correlated to serum biomarkers (NT-pro-BNP and cTnT).
RESULTS:
Eighteen patients (34.6%) developed cardiac disease (NYHA I-III). An increasing cumulative anthracycline dose was associated with a decrease of the EF determined by echocardiography as well the SV by USCOM and with a higher NYHA class. Those patients who experienced cardiac disease showed a reduction of the EF and SV and increased serum biomarkers.
CONCLUSIONS:
Real-time CW-Doppler USCOM, is a fast and reliable method to monitor late hemodynamic changes as a symptom of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity comparable to the findings by echocardiography and serum biomarkers.

Abstract
Quality of life (QOL) has become an increasingly meaningful endpoint in advanced cancer research. Clinicians assess QOL to help them select appropriate treatment options and regimens. The present review aims to compare QOL scores of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General Assessment Tool (FACT-G) in relation to clinical and socio-demographic features in patients with advanced cancer. A literature search in MEDLINE and EMBASE was conducted; a total of 33 studies encompassing 39 study arms were identified that reported FACT-G scores. Four statistically significant parameters were identified with respect to FACT-G scores: education, national per capita healthcare expenditures, admittance status and previous radiation therapy. A greater percentage of patients completing higher education programs were correlated to significantly better emotional well-being and global QOL. Cohorts from countries with higher national per capita healthcare expenditures had better physical well-being, social/family well-being and improved relationships with their doctors. Patient samples comprised of purely outpatients had better levels of emotional well-being and global QOL when compared to samples with a mix of outpatients and inpatients. A greater percentage of patients previously receiving radiation therapy were correlated to a better relationship with doctor score. Although limitations of the present review exist, differences in QOL scores based on socio-demographic and clinical factors are observed; certain correlations described in the present work have been described previously in the literature while others have not. Future work aimed at either determining confounding parameters or cause and effect relationships is recommended.

Preservation of Fertility in Female Cancer Patients Desiring Future Child Bearing; What is Available and What can be Offered.

Husseinzadeh N1, Husseinzadeh HD2.
Author information
Abstract
The aim of this review is to present an overview of available methods for preservation of ovarian function and fertility in female cancer patients who desire to maintain their child-bearing capacity for future pregnancies. A Medline search was conducted. Published articles from American and European studies from 1976 to present were reviewed. The effect of cancer treatment on the ovary, as well as different methods of fertility preservation and their reproductive outcomes are presented. Pregnancy rates vary according to the type of primary malignancy, stage of disease, method of fertility preservation (for example, hormonal therapy, cryopreservation, fertility-sparing surgery), and other confounding factors such as the patient's age, reproductive capacity, status of partnership, and genetic disposition. The highest rates of successful pregnancy were observed with embryo cryopreservation. Today, higher cure rates and longer survival are a result of earlier cancer diagnosis and treatment. In conjunction with the advances in assisted reproduction, the preservation of ovarian function and fertility is a major part of multidisciplinary care that should be offered to any young female patient with cancer. Fertility preservation in young cancer patients raises a number of ethical issues particularly regarding standard versus experimental therapies, and long-term financial cost.

Abstract
BACKGROUND:
The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Brain (FACT-Br) is a quality of life (QOL) assessment tool that was originally developed for use in patients with primary brain tumors. However, the tool has also been used to assess QOL in patients with metastatic brain tumors. The purpose of this study is to compare the differences in QOL responses as assessed by the FACT-Br in patients with primary and metastatic brain neoplasms.
METHODS:
A systematic literature search was conducted using the OvidSP platform in MEDLINE (1946 to July Week 2 2012) and EMBASE (1980 to 2012 Week 28). Articles in which the FACT-Br was used as a QOL assessment for patients with malignant brain tumors (both primary and metastatic) were included in the study. The weighted means of FACT-Br subscale and overall scores were calculated for the studies. To compare these scores, weighted analysis of variance was conducted and PROC GLM was performed for the data. A P-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
RESULTS:
A total of 23 studies (four in brain metastases, 18 in primary brain tumors and 1 in a mixed sample) using the FACT-Br for assessment of QOL were identified. Social and functional well-being were significantly better in patients with primary brain tumors (weighted mean score of 22.2 vs. 10.7, P = 0.0026, 16.9 vs. 6.2, P = 0.0025, respectively). No other scale of the FACT-Br was significantly different between the two groups and the performance status of patients included in both groups was similar.
CONCLUSION:
Patients with primary brain cancer seemed to have better social and functional well-being scores than those with metastatic brain tumors. Other QOL domains were similar between these two groups. However, the heterogeneity in the included studies and the low sample size of included samples in patients with metastatic brain tumors could have confounded our findings.

Maintenance Chemotherapy Use for Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer in an Australian Cancer Centre.

Wann A1, Newnham G1.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:
To investigate the rates of maintenance therapy in advanced non-small cell cancer, the reasons for not progressing to second line therapy at disease progression at our cancer centre and to use this data as a way to institute it into clinical practice in our cancer centre.
METHOD:
This study was approved by the ethics committee. The data was collected from a purpose built cancer unit database, patient and pharmacy records for all patients diagnosed with Stage 3 and 4 non-small cell lung cancer between 2005 - 2011. Demographic information was collected and subgroup analysis of mean overall survival was obtained. Reasons for not progressing to second line therapy were also analysed.
RESULTS:
Of the 105 patients available for analysis, 44 achieved stable disease/partial response (SD/PR) post first cycle of which 42 were eligible for maintenance chemotherapy, 7 went onto receive maintenance with a mean overall survival (OS) of 18.26 months, 23 received second line with the highest OS of 28.19 months and 12 didn't receive either with the lowest OS of 11.52 months. The majority of these patients did not receive second line at disease progression because of being too unwell.
CONCLUSION:
Similar data on the progression to second line chemotherapy in this patient group was seen. Those that received second line chemotherapy had higher overall survival and thus maintenance therapy could be a means to allow patients to be fit enough to receive second line when they need it.

Health Care Professionals' Evaluation of Quality of Life Issues in Patients With Brain Metastases.

Lauzon N1, Bedard G1, Zhang L1, Sahgal A1, Zeng L1, Koo K1, Chow E1.
Author information
Abstract
BACKGROUND:
The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Brain (FACT-Br) is a brain specific Quality of life (QOL) tool used for patients in the primary and metastatic cancer population. The purpose of this report is to evaluate the QOL issues health care professionals (HCPs) find most important when caring for brain metastases patients.
METHODS:
HCPs were asked to rate whether each of the 23 FACT-Br subscale items were relevant to patients or not. In the survey, HCPs indicated the 5 to 10 top issues affecting the QOL of patients with brain metastases. Demographic information such as gender, years of experience, and health care specialty were recorded.
RESULTS:
A total of 46 HCPs participated in the study, 89% of HCPs ranked the need for help in caring for themselves as the most relevant item for patients with brain metastases. Other highly relevant items included the concern of getting headaches (81%) and weakness in arms or legs (78%). The lowest rated items included the ability to put thoughts together (8%), ability to write as they used to (11%) and also the ability to read as they used to (14%).
CONCLUSION:
It is very important to determine the issues that HCPs think are most important to patients in an attempt to harmonize these with those of patients. Future studies should compare the items that HCPs rate as most relevant to those that patients rate to ensure agreeability.

On 6 August 2013 the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) commissioned the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) to conduct a supplementary assessment for Commission A13-10 (benefit assessment of pertuzumab). In the commenting procedure on the assessment of pertuzumab, on 18 July 2013, the pharmaceutical company (hereinafter abbreviated to “the company”) submitted further data to the G-BA that went beyond the information in the dossier. These refer to data on the CLEOPATRA study (comparison of pertuzumab / trastuzumab / docetaxel versus trastuzumab / docetaxel). The study was already contained in the company’s dossier and was included as relevant by IQWiG in Assessment A13-10. The data presented were not evaluable for the outcomes on adverse events (AEs). With the comments, the company subsequently submitted new analyses, which, from the company's point of view, allow to assess the AEs. The G-BA commissioned IQWiG with the assessment of the analyses subsequently submitted for the CLEOPATRA study in the commenting procedure. The results on AEs were to be assessed under consideration of the data presented in the dossier and in the company's comment. In addition, the question was to be addressed to what extent consequences result from this supplementary assessment for the reliability of the conclusions for the overall result of the benefit assessment. In the following Chapter 2 the additional results for the CLEOPATRA study are assessed according to the commission. The extent and probability of added benefit of pertuzumab are then described under consideration of the analyses subsequently submitted. The responsibility for the present assessment and the results of the assessment lies exclusively with IQWiG. The assessment is forwarded to the G-BA. The G-BA decides on the added benefit.

On 23 July 2013, the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) commissioned the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) to conduct a supplementary assessment for Commission A13-09 (benefit assessment of vandetanib [new assessment in accordance with §35a (5) Social Code Book (SGB) V]). In the commenting procedure on the assessment of vandetanib, on 8 July 2013 the pharmaceutical company (hereinafter abbreviated to “the company”) submitted further data to the G-BA that went beyond the information in the dossier. These refer to data on Study D4200C00058 (comparison of vandetanib + best supportive care (BSC) versus placebo + BSC). The study was already contained in the company’s dossier and was included as relevant by IQWiG in Assessment A13-09. On the basis of the data presented by the company in the dossier, the severity of pain symptoms during the course of the study could not be assessed. Moreover, the majority of the data presented were not evaluable for the outcomes on adverse events (AEs). The data subsequently submitted mainly addressed the uncertainties on these outcomes from the Study D4200C00058 with new analyses.

On 28 May 2013 the Federal Joint Committee (G-BA) commissioned the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) to conduct a supplementary assessment for Commission A13-06 (benefit assessment of abiraterone acetate [new therapeutic indication]). In the commenting procedure on the assessment of abiraterone acetate (hereinafter abbreviated to “abiraterone”), the pharmaceutical company (hereinafter abbreviated to “the company”) submitted further data to the G-BA on 6 May 2015 going beyond the information in the dossier. These refer to data from Study COU-AA-302 (comparison of abiraterone + prednisone + conventional androgen deprivation therapy [ADT] and placebo + prednisone + ADT). The study was already contained in the company’s dossier and was included as relevant by IQWiG in Assessment A13-06. However, on the basis of data presented by the company in the dossier, no data or hardly any evaluable data were available, particularly for the outcomes “health-related quality of life” (HRQoL) and “adverse events” (AEs). The data subsequently submitted mainly comprised new analyses of these outcomes from Study COU-AA-302. The G-BA commissioned IQWiG with the assessment of the analyses subsequently submitted in the commenting procedure for Study COU-AA-302. In this context the data were to be assessed with regard to the question as to whether, under consideration of the analyses submitted by the company on HRQoL (response criterion), as well as on AEs, an added benefit of abiraterone regarding HRQoL is proven and uncertainties regarding harm have been dispelled. In the following Chapter 2 the additional results for Study COU-AA-302 are presented and assessed according to the commission. The extent and probability of added benefit of abiraterone are then described under consideration of the analyses subsequently submitted. The responsibility for the present assessment and the result of the assessment lies exclusively with IQWiG. The assessment is forwarded to the G-BA. The decision on added benefit is made by the G-BA.

The aim of this report is to assess the added benefit of vandetanib compared to best supportive care (BSC) as appropriate comparator therapy (ACT) in patients with aggressive and symptomatic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic disease. The comparator therapy chosen by the company corresponded to the ACT previously specified by the Federal Joint Committee. In the current therapeutic situation, there is a need for all patients to be treated with BSC. Studies that compared vandetanib in combination with BSC with treatment consisting of BSC alone were therefore included in the benefit assessment. If available, studies in which vandetanib as monotherapy was compared with BSC could also be included. The assessment was based on patient-relevant outcomes. Direct comparative randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included in the assessment.

Abstract
A 1-year-old boy with no underlying disorder presented with non-bilious vomiting since 4 days before admission. He was referred to our hospital and was diagnosed with a small bowel obstruction due to an intraabdominal tumor. Laparotomy revealed an intestinal volvulus with a soft and lobulated tumor arising from the mesentery. The resected tumor with a small part of the small bowel was diagnosed as lipoblastoma histologically. From a literature review, mesenteric lipoblastoma with an intestinal volvulus showed different characteristics such as greater frequency of vomiting and less frequency of abdominal mass as clinical symptoms, and the size of the tumor was smaller than that of the tumor without the intestinal volvulus.

Excerpt
The research question of the report was divided into several sub-goals:Sub-goal A: Determination of the risk of disease in people with a positive family history. Within the framework of sub-goal A the risk of developing colorectal cancer or dying from the disease was determined in people with a positive family history.Sub-goal B: Assessment of the diagnostic accuracy of family history tools. Within the framework of sub-goal B it was examined how reliable (i.e. with what diagnostic accuracy) family history tools that could be used during screening can identify people with a higher risk due to a positive family history within the normal population.Sub-goal C: Comparative benefit assessment of comprehensive screening strategies using family history tools. Within the framework of sub-goal C the question was to be answered as to what benefit a screening strategy offers in which a family history tool was initially to be applied in the normal population under 55 years of age to identify patients at higher risk due to a positive family history. People with a positive test result were subsequently to be offered to participate in a screening procedure. In this context it was also of interest whether different screening strategies (e.g. use of different family history tools) differed in their benefit.Sub-goal D: Comparative benefit assessment of different screening procedures within a screening strategy in persons with an increased risk due to a positive family history. If no studies were found for sub-goal C, it was to be examined what benefit different measures within the framework of modified screening had for people in whom an increased risk due to a positive family history had already been determined. This related to different screening procedures (especially colonoscopy and faecal occult-blood testing, FOBT) but also to other potential differences in the screening strategies (e.g. different time intervals between the tests).

Excerpt
Interventions that impact upon survival form a high proportion of the treatments appraised by NICE, and in these it is essential to accurately estimate the survival benefit associated with the new intervention. This is made difficult because survival data is often censored, meaning that extrapolation techniques must be used to obtain estimates of the full survival benefit. Where such analyses are not completed estimates of the survival benefit will be restricted to that observed directly in the relevant clinical trial(s) and this is likely to represent an underestimate of the true survival gain. This leads to underestimates of the Quality Adjusted Life Years gained, and therefore results in inaccurate estimates of cost-effectiveness. There are a number of methods available for performing extrapolation. Exponential, Weibull, Gompertz, log-logistic or log normal parametric models can be used, as well as more complex and flexible models. The different methods have varying functional forms and are likely to result in different survival estimates, with the differences potentially large – particularly when a substantial amount of extrapolation is required. It is therefore very important to justify the particular extrapolation approach chosen, to demonstrate that extrapolation has been undertaken appropriately and so that decision makers can be confident in the results of the associated economic analysis. Statistical tests can be used to compare alternative models and their relative fit to the observed trial data. This is important, particularly when there is only a small amount of censoring in the dataset and thus the extrapolation required is minimal. However it is of even greater importance to justify the plausibility of the extrapolated portion of the survival model chosen, as this is likely to have a very large influence on the estimated mean survival. This is difficult, but may be achieved through the use of external data sources, biological plausbility, or clinical expert opinion. A review of the survival analyses included in NICE Technology Appraisals (TAs) of metastatic and/or advanced cancer interventions demonstrates that a wide range of methods have been used. This is to be expected, because different methods will be appropriate in different circumstances and contexts. However the review also clearly demonstrates that in the vast majority of TAs a systematic approach to survival analysis has not been taken, and the extent to which chosen methods have been justified differs markedly between TAs and is usually sub-optimal. In the form of a Survival Model Selection Process algorithm we provide recommendations for how survival analysis can be undertaken more systematically. This involves fitting and testing a range of survival models and comparing these based upon internal validity (how well they fit to the observed trial data) and external validity (how plausible their extrapolated portions are). Following this process should improve the likelihood that appropriate survival models are chosen, leading to more robust economic evaluations.

Laparoscopic abdomino-perineal resection for patients with anorectal malignant melanoma: a report of 4 cases.

Han J1, Shi C2, Dong X1, Wang J1, Wen H1, Wang B1, He Z3.
Author information
Abstract
Anorectal malignant melanoma is a very rare but lethal disease. Patients with anorectal malignant melanoma commonly complain for changes in bowel habits and rectal bleeding. Therefore, anorectal malignant melanoma is often misdiagnosed as hemorrhoids, polyp or rectal cancer. Surgery is the mainstay of treatment for patients with anorectal malignant melanoma. However, whether abdominoperineal resection or wide local excision is the most appropriate surgical approach is still a controversial issue. Recently, with the great development of laparoscopic techniques, more and more operations can be performed by laparoscopic techniques. However, laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection for management of anorectal malignant melanoma has been rarely reported. In this study, we reported 4 patients with anorectal malignant melanoma underwent laparoscopic abdominoperineal resection. The outcomes of these patients were relatively good during a long time follow-up. Meanwhile, we reviewed the relevant studies with particular focus surgical treatment.

[Total-endoscopic Thyroid Resection in ABBA-Technique: Comments on the Integration of Intraoperative Neuromonitoring].

[Article in German]
Jonas J1.
Author information
Abstract
Background: Total endoscopic thyroid resections without any scars on the neck are a special challenge for the surgeon. Clinical results of intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) in the axillo-bilateral-breast-approach (ABBA) have not been described so far. Methods: 29 female patients (~ 40 years) were operated for one-sided thyroid pathology using the ABBA technique (20 subtotal resections, 9 hemithyroidectomies). Suspected malignoma, size > 35 mL, known thyroiditis and recurrencies were excluded. For stimulation a 30-cm handprobe and for signal deviation a tube adhesive electrode (ISIS; Fa. Inomed, Emmendingen, Germany) were used. Results: The average operation time was 132 minutes. Intraoperative blood loss necessitated conversion to the open procedure in 1 case. A single tube electrode dislocation occurred. In the alternative a bipolar needle electrode was inserted percutaneously through the cricothyroid ligament. One intraoperative signal loss was confirmed by the laryngoscopic finding of vocal cord paresis, which recovered within 6 months. An additional case of incomplete brachial plexus paralysis was observed with a 2-day recovery time. Conclusion: Direct neuromonitoring of the recurrent laryngeal nerve can be easily applied in the total endoscopic ABBA technique for thyroid resection. Vagal stimulation, which is obligatory in open thyroid surgery, cannot consequently be included in this endoscopic operation method. Unexpected tube electrode dislocation may cause IONM misinterpretation. A risk of double-sided vocal cord palsy is theoretically present.

Parathyroid carcinoma in tertiary hyperparathyroidism.

Kim BS1, Ryu HS2, Kang KH3, Park SJ1.
Author information
Abstract
Parathyroid carcinoma is a rare disease of unknown etiology. This study presents a case of parathyroid carcinoma in a patient with tertiary hyperparathyroidism. Despite a successful kidney transplantation, the intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) level of the patient was elevated consistently and could not be controlled by medical therapy. Due to the development of tertiary hyperparathyroidism with bone pain and osteoporosis, subtotal parathyroidectomy was performed 4 months after the kidney transplantation. Histological evaluation revealed that one of four parathyroid lesions was a parathyroid carcinoma, while the others were diffuse hyperplasia. Postoperative laboratory studies indicated a decreased level of iPTH. A positron emission tomography-computed tomography performed 6 months after the operation revealed no evidence of local recurrence or distant metastasis.

Excerpt
Background: An estimated 22% of U.S. adults are current cigarette smokers. Smoking prevalence rates for those in substance abuse treatment (SAT) exceeded 70% between 2005 & 2009. Individuals in SAT smoke more heavily than the general population, and consequently are more likely to suffer from tobacco-related morbidity, including cardiopulmonary problems, emphysema, and cancer, than are smokers in the general population. Methods: Data from the 2011 National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services (N-SSATS), an annual survey of all known substance abuse treatment facilities, both public and private in the U.S., was analyzed. Facilities offering "any" tobacco cessation service (TCS) provided any one or a combination of the following services: tobacco cessation counseling, nicotine replacement medication, and/or non-nicotine tobacco cessation medication were included in this analysis. Results: In 2011, 5,737 SAT facilities, 42% of all such facilities in the U.S., offered TCS. 58% of facilities located in the Northeast offered TCS compared with 40% of facilities in the West, 38% of facilities in the South, and 34% of facilities in the Midwest. 44% of SAT facilities that offered TCS prohibited smoking anywhere compared with facilities that did not offer these services (27%). 72% of SAT facilities that offered any type of TCS provided screening for tobacco use, compared to 34% of facilities that did not offer TCS. Conclusion: TCS provide important benefits that can improve the short- and long-term health of clients in SAT and can enhance drug and alcohol treatment outcomes. Yet this report shows that less than half of treatment facilities nationwide provide TCS. Notably, the Census regions with the heaviest rates of smoking and tobacco-related mortality and morbidity - the Midwest and South - are the regions in which facilities are least likely to offer TCS. Compared with other regions, the Northeast has more treatment facilities that offer TCS, are operated by the Federal Government, or have a primary general health care focus. Many of these findings are expected given the policies that typically prohibit tobacco use in hospitals, other health care facilities, and Federal and some State government facilities.

Excerpt
Improving the healthcare of Americans with multiple chronic conditions is one of the top aims of the U.S. national healthcare research agenda. One of the driving forces behind this objective is the disproportionately high concentration of healthcare expenditures that are attributed to this population. The 2009 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) found that the sickest 10 percent of patients account for 65 percent of all health expenses for the U.S. population (from July 2012 meeting of the National Advisory Council for Healthcare Research and Quality, which focused on trends in healthcare costs and the concentration of medical expenditures).1 Further, the MEPS identified a number of chronic conditions that most influence high levels of expenditures, including heart disease, cancer, mental disorders, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and diabetes. Potentially preventable readmissions are among the disproportionately high concentration of healthcare expenditures attributed to the sickest 10 percent of patients. In their June 2007 report to Congress, the MedPAC (Medical Payment Advisory Commission) estimated that 75 percent of Medicare readmissions are potentially preventable.2 Potentially preventable hospitalizations have been linked to discontinuity of primary care.3 In a 1984 randomized trial, elderly male Veterans who saw a different physician at each visit had a statistically significantly higher rate of emergent hospital admissions and longer average length of stays than those who saw the same primary care doctor at every visit.3 Since the 1980's, the problem of high-risk patients with frequent hospital admissions has persisted despite dramatic changes in the practice environment. One important change is the redesign of primary care. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) Primary Care Program Office is implementing a Patient Aligned Care Teams (PACT) model at all primary care sites, in which continuous care is delivered by interdisciplinary teams who serve as the first point of contact for a broad range of fully-integrated health services and community resources. The VA's PACT model and other Patient-Centered Medical Home (PCMH) models are based on earlier innovations such as the Chronic Care Model, the Idealized Design of Clinical Office Practices, and Clinical Microsystems. They seek to implement primary care that is continuous, comprehensive, efficient, patient-driven and team-based.4,5 The PCMH models are not primarily aimed at patients who are at high risk of hospital admission, although most include reducing hospitalizations and emergency room use among their secondary aims. In the VA PACT, for example, hospital care and specialized services are provided outside of the PACT, while coordinators focus on smoothing hand-offs between care settings including those involving VA and non-VA providers. A recent Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) systematic review of 19 comparative studies found that implementation of these models had no effect on hospital admissions (RR 0.96; 95% CI 0.84-1.10), but it reduced emergency room visits (0.81, 0.67-0.98) and modestly improved staff and patient experiences.6 Disease management and care coordination programs have also sought to improve the quality and delivery of care to patients with high-cost chronic illnesses. The U.S. Congressional Budget Office (CBO) issued a brief report (January 2012) on the effects of 34 Medicare demonstration projects on disease management and care coordination programs, and cited the following approaches as helpful in reducing hospital admissions: (1) use of team-based care, especially those with larger teams that include pharmacists; and (2) the smoothing of transitions between a primary care provider and a specialist.7 However, a recent AHRQ review of nurse-led case management programs for adults with medical illnesses and complex care needs found no effect on rates of hospitalization and a variable effect on emergency room use.8 The nurse-led interventions encompassed patient self-management education, health status monitoring, and coordination of care, typified by the Medicare Coordinated Care Demonstration (MCCD). From the viewpoint of caring for frequently hospitalized patients, the rise of hospitalism also poses a challenge to continuity of care. David Meltzer, MD, PhD, Associate Professor of Medicine and Director of the Hospitalist Program at the University of Chicago Medicine, has studied the changing medical workforce in the United States and found that the trend toward increased medical specialization has had the unintended consequence of increased fragmentation of primary care.9 One of the key challenges for the primary care system in meeting the complex needs of high-risk patients with multiple chronic conditions is adapting to the increased demands of collaborating with a larger number of associated healthcare providers within a decentralized, fee-for-service healthcare delivery system which does not pay for or facilitate communication or coordination among providers.7 Some would say that we have reached a point where we have to decide if we should continue to invest in programs with an increased need for coordination or in different models that reduce the need for coordination in the first place. Applying team theory literature,10 Dr. Meltzer has said “if you're spending all of your time coordinating, you should change the product.”11 For example, Dr. Meltzer has proposed a ‘comprehensive care physician model,’ to reduce the need for coordination between the primary care and hospitalist settings. In this model, a physician with expertise in both inpatient medicine and primary care leads an interdisciplinary team that carries a panel of approximately 200 frequently hospitalized patients, who they will treat both inside and outside of the hospital.11 The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) have funded a demonstration of this program at the University of Chicago. Others focus on reducing the need for coordination and handoffs between primary care and specialty care. From this viewpoint, admissions from primary care could be reduced through accelerated consults or direct access to intense short stay and complex diagnostic unit services. The persistence of high inpatient utilizers despite the spread of case management and PCMH models has led to interest in ‘intensive primary care’ models. For example, a new round of CMS-funded demonstration projects focus on intensive models for patients at high risk of using inpatient resources.12 In their Research Brief published by the National Institute for Health Care Reform, Yee et al. proposed a taxonomy for categorizing ‘High-Intensity Primary Care’ programs, also sometimes called ‘Ambulatory Intensive Care Units,’ which use PCMH-based approaches to managing the sickest, highest-cost patients.13 In a ‘freestanding’ model, ongoing care is fully transferred from patients' regular primary care physicians to a dedicated clinic that exclusively or chiefly provides high-intensity primary care to a select group of patients. In contrast, in a ‘practice-based’ model, patients continue to receive care from their regular primary care physician, but are offered additional, high-intensity services, often managed by a care coordinator. In a hybrid model, care is temporarily shifted from the patients' regular primary care physicians to a dedicated clinic, and returned once their conditions stabilize. These approaches, which involve physician-led, team-based discussion and coordination that serve as the source of primary care, were excluded from the two AHRQ reviews mentioned earlier. As part of the PACT model initiative, the Health Delivery Committee is proposing to develop a primary care intensivist model that deploys well-trained interdisciplinary teams that identify and proactively manage Veterans at highest risk for hospital admission and death. The goal of the model is to reduce emergency department and urgent care utilization, hospitalizations and mortality among complex, high-risk patients. For healthcare system decision-makers, evidence is only one of many different factors taken into account. If a health system waits until there is traditional hard and fast evidence on the effectiveness of a new healthcare model, they would always be 10 years out of date. However, decision-makers do need to consider the findings of the best available research and the strength and applicability of that evidence. This report was produced in response to the Health Delivery Committee's request for an evidence brief to assist with their evaluation of the effectiveness of existing intensive primary care programs involving multimodal interventions delivered by interdisciplinary teams. An evidence brief differs from a full systematic review in that the scope of work is more narrowly defined and the traditional review methods are streamlined in order to synthesize evidence within a shortened timeframe. An evidence brief cannot capture the actual day-to-day program operations of evolving programs. While decision-makers can benefit from knowing about the best available research and the strength and applicability of that evidence, an evidence brief cannot encompass the full range of policy options or novel programs, many of which have not been evaluated in formal studies.

Abstract
Adrenal tumors with more than one cellular component are uncommon. Furthermore, an adrenal tumor composed of a pheochromocytoma and a malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor is extremely rare. A composite pheochromocytoma with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor in a 42-year-old man is reported here. After adequate preoperative control, left adrenalectomy was performed simultaneously with resection of the ipsilateral kidney for spontaneous rupture of the left adrenal tumor. Pathological findings demonstrated pheochromocytoma and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor in a ruptured adrenal tumor. To date, there have been only four reported cases of composite pheochromocytoma with malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, so the present case is only the fifth case in the world. Despite the very poor prognosis of patients with pheochromocytoma and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors reported in the literature, the patient remains well without evidence of recurrence or new metastatic lesions at 36 months postoperatively.

Abstract
Thymic epithelial tumour (TET) histologic subclassification has not been well described in the veterinary literature as it has in humans. The objective of this study was to identify and describe TET subtypes in dogs and to determine the utility of immunohistochemistry (IHC) in differentiating these subtypes. Samples were reviewed and classified according to a modified World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for human tumours of thymic origin. Signallment, presenting signs, treatment and survival data was collected from medical records. Histologic review confirmed the same subtypes as described in humans. Presence of high stage disease, pleomorphism, mitotic figures and capsular invasion was more common in atypical thymomas and thymic carcinomas than in thymomas. IHC was performed for GLUT-1, CD5, CD117 and CK8/18; however, this was not useful in classifying the tumours.

Preoperative Scintigrams to Identify the Sentinel Lymph Node in Breast Cancer: a Waste of Time?

Sharma N1, Pinto A2, Notghi A3, Sintler M3.
Author information
Abstract
Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) remains the gold standard for assessing axillary node status in breast cancer. Preoperative scintigrams have been used to identify the sentinel lymph node (SLN); however, their use is controversial. Studies suggest they add little to successful SLN detection in theatre, immediately prior to node excision. They have been associated with high false negatives, time expense, patient dissatisfaction, and unnecessary costs. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of scintigrams in comparison to intraoperative SLN identification techniques. This study included all patients undergoing a SLNB for breast cancer from April 2010 to 2011. Scintigram reports, operation notes, and histology results were analyzed. Mann-Whitney U and chi-squared tests were used for statistical analysis of data. Two hundred nineteen female patients with a median age of 59.6 years (24.0-89.9 years) were included in this study. Scintigram was performed in 185 and not in 34 patients due to time constraints. Combined γ-probe and Isosulfan blue dye for SLN detection (intraoperative methods) have an identification rate of 98.2 % (p = 0.005), compared to 92.4 % (p = 0.088) from scintigrams alone. Scintigrams confer no additional advantage to the operating surgeon for successful SLN detection and excision in theatre. Intraoperative SLN identification is more accurate and reliable. Routine scintigram use is unjustified and should be withdrawn from current practice.

Abstract
Rectal cancer is one of the common cancers in India. Surgical management is the mainstay of initial treatment for majority of patients. Minimally invasive surgery has gained acceptance for the surgical treatment of rectal cancer because, compared with laparotomy, it is associated with fewer complications, shorter hospitalization, and faster recovery. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety, feasibility, technique, and outcomes (postoperative, oncological, and functional) of robotic-assisted rectal surgery in comparison with open surgery in the Indian population. A prospective randomized study was undertaken from August 2011 to December 2012. Fifty patients who presented with rectal carcinoma were randomized to either robotic arm (RA) or open arm (OA) group. Both groups were matched for clinical stage and operation type. Technique and feasibility of robotic-assisted surgery in terms of operating time, estimated blood loss, margins status, total number of lymph nodes retrieved, hospital stay, conversion to open procedure, complications, and functional outcomes were analyzed. The mean operative time was significantly longer in the RA than in the OA group (310 vs 246 min, P < 0.001) but was significantly reduced in the latter part of the robotic-assisted patients compared with the initial patients. The mean estimated blood loss was significantly less in the RA compared with the OA group (165.14 vs 406.04 ml, P < 0.001). None of the patients had margin positivity. The mean distal resection margin was significantly longer in the RA than in the OA group (3.6 vs 2.4 cm, P < 0.001). A total of 100 % of patients in the RA group had complete mesorectal excision while two patients in the OA group had incomplete mesorectal excision. The average number of retrieved lymph nodes was adequate for accurate staging. The number of lymph nodes removed by robotic method is slightly higher than the open method (16.88 vs 15.20) but with no statistical significance. Conversion rate was nil. The mean hospital stay was significantly shorter in the RA group (7.52 vs 13.24 days, P < 0.001). Postoperative and functional outcomes were comparable between the two groups. Robotic-assisted surgery is an emerging technique in our country. Robotic-assisted rectal cancer surgery is safe with low conversion rates and acceptable morbidity and is oncologically feasible.

Excerpt
Herein we report the discovery and structure activity relationship (SAR) of a novel, small molecule (ML327) that restores E-cadherin expression through regulation of E-cadherin transcription. ML327 was discovered via an iterative parallel synthesis optimization of a first generation ligand, but ML327 is >50-fold more effective in restoring E-cadherin expression. This transcriptional regulator (CID 60167648, ML327) displays an In-Cell Western EC50 value of 1.0 μM and is inactive (>30 μM) against all know epigenetic targets (HDACs, MMPs, sirtuins, etc.) that increase E-cadherin expression, and clean in a Ricerca ancillary pharmacology panel. ML327 possesses favorable physiochemical properties, an excellent dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK) profile. Thus, ML327 is valuable probe for studying E-cadherin expression in tumor cell lines via a novel mechanism of regulating E-cadherin transcription.

Author information
Abstract
There is no widely accepted standard of care for canine anal sac apocrine gland adenocarcinoma (ASAGAC). Surgery alone is inadequate in many cases, but the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy is not well established. The primary objective of this retrospective study was to evaluate the role of carboplatin chemotherapy in the post-operative management of ASAGAC. Seventy-four dogs with naturally occurring ASAGAC underwent surgery. Forty-four dogs received adjuvant carboplatin and 30 did not. Median overall survival (OS) was 703 days. Median time to progression (TTP) was 384 days. Only primary tumour size and lymph node metastasis at diagnosis significantly impacted the outcome. Differences in OS and TTP, between the dogs that received adjuvant carboplatin and those that did not, failed to reach statistical significance. Treatment of progressive disease, whilst not limited to chemotherapy, significantly prolonged the survival. This study shows that adjuvant carboplatin chemotherapy is well tolerated and may have a role in the management of dogs with ASAGAC.

Malone Antegrade Continence Enema in Patients with Perineal Colostomy After Rectal Resection.

Wang JH1, Xu JH1, Ye F1, Xu XM1, Lin JJ1, Chen WB1.
Author information
Abstract
The objective of this study was to evaluate the value of antegrade continence enema (Malone operation) in abdominoperineal resection (Miles' operation). Between January 2008 and May 2009, five cancer patients (two men and three women) underwent abdominoperineal resection and digestive reconstruction by perineal colostomy and Malone antegrade continence enema in our institution. Their functional results and quality of life were recorded. None of the patients died, but two had wound infections and one experienced urinary retention. Patients performed antegrade enema every 24 h with 2,000 mL of normal saline by themselves. The duration of the enema lasted for an average of approximately 35 min, and fecal contamination was not detected at 24 h. Patient satisfaction was determined to be 88 %. Malone antegrade continence enema associated with abdominoperineal resection and perineal colostomy provided acceptable continence. It preserved the body image of the patients and resulted in a satisfactory quality of life. It is a potential alternative for patients who are not willing to have a permanent colostomy.

Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumours: Review of 150 Cases from a Single Centre.

Author information
Abstract
Gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) are the most common mesenchymal tumours of the gastrointestinal tract. They constitute a significant percentage ranging from 1-2 % of all the gastrointestinal neoplasms [11]. Knowledge on the molecular biology and behavior of these tumours is still not very clear. The clinicopathologial features are variable and surgical resection with chemotherapy is the main modality of treatment. We have retrospectively analyzed the clinicopathological features, treatment and prognosis of 150 patients managed in the Department of Surgery. Retrospective review of the records of 150 patients diagnosed with gastrointestinal stromal tumours and managed during the period January 2006 to December 2011. Clinicopathological features, immunohistochemistry, mitotic index, surgical resection adjuvant chemotherapy and survival analyzed. One hundred and fifty patients diagnosed with GIST and treated were reviewed. Ninety five of them were males (63.3 %). The tumour was most commonly seen during the fourth and fifth decades of life. Abdominal pain (52 %), intestinal bleeding (40 %) and abdominal mass (25 %) were the common clinical symptoms. Sixty percent of the tumours (90/150) were located in the stomach followed by small bowel (20 %) and duodenum (14.6 %). One hundred and thirty-five patients underwent excision of the tumour and five patients had multi organ resection of the adjacent organs like spleen, tail of the pancreas and kidney. Fifteen patients (10 %) received neoadjuvant Imatinib for down staging of the tumour prior to surgery. The tumour size ranged from 1 to 34 cm. One third of the tumours (42/150) belonged to the high-grade category. KIT protein (CD117) was positive in 90 %( 135/150), while CD34 was positive in 50 % (74/150) of tumours. Majority of the patients with high and intermediate-risk category received adjuvant Imatinib (65/77). Seventeen patients (11.3 %) developed recurrence of the tumour on follow-up and rest of the patients had stable disease. Eight of the 15 patients (53 %) who had advanced disease developed recurrence of the disease over 6 months to 1 year. Fifteen patients died on follow-up between 2 and 5 years. Gastrointestinal tumours are the most common non epithelial tumour of the GIT. GISTS are found to show a male preponderance and are common during the fourth and fifth decades. Abdominal pain and intestinal bleeding are the most common clinical presentation. Most of the tumours were located in the stomach. Surgical resection is the best modality of treatment for operable lesions. Tyrosine kinase receptor (KIT) inhibitor like imatinib is used for adjuvant treatment. Regular follow-up with ultra sonogram or computed tomogram helps in diagnosing disease recurrence.

HER2 Expression in Gastric and Gastroesophageal Cancer: Report from a Tertiary Care Hospital in North India.

Tewari M1, Kumar A1, Mishra RR2, Kumar M3, Shukla HS1.
Author information
Abstract
Despite improvements in chemotherapy, survival of metastatic gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma remains poor. Trastuzumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), has shown promise in improving survival of these patients by a recent large phase III trial. HER2 status in gastric and GEJ cancers, although reported from across the world, is yet unknown in India due to lack of published literature from the country. HER2 status in 70 samples of gastric and GEJ adenocarcinomas (Siewert type III) was evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in this study using the gastric cancer scoring system. It was also correlated with clinic-pathologic factors. Samples with IHC score 2+ and 3+ were taken as HER2 positive. HER2 overexpression was found in 15 (21.4 %) samples, was significantly (p = 0.006) more common in intestinal type (45 %), but it did not correlate with age, gender, stage, or grade of tumor and did not affect the 2-year disease-free survival. HER2 overexpression is found only in a minority of patients with gastric and GEJ cancers in the Indian population. A large cohort of patients with a longer follow-up will be required to assess for any significant statistical association of HER2 expression with prognosis of these patients.

Low or Ultralow Anterior Resection of Rectal Cancer Without Diverting Stoma: Experience with 28 Patients.

Soltani E1, Jangjoo A2, Saremi E2.
Author information
Abstract
A diverting temporary stoma is frequently used to decrease the chance of anastomosis leakage in the middle and lower rectum cancer surgeries, but its role in preventing the leakage is still doubtful. This study has been designed to evaluate any possible anastomosis complications after a rectum resection and a low or ultralow anastomosis when no diverting stoma is applied in patients with rectal cancer. Twenty-eight patients suffering from rectal cancer were treated by a low anterior resection between the years 2005 and 2008 in Imam Reza University Hospital, Mashhad, Iran. Out of the 28 patients, 6 patients had already undergone a course of neoadjuvant radiotherapy. Anastomosis was performed manually in 23 patients, using a stapler in 5 of them. None of the patients had a diverting stoma. Then, the outcome was evaluated. Fecal incontinence occurred in one of the patients (6.7 %) who had already undergone a course of radiotherapy preoperatively and had a stapler used for anastomosis. No leakage was detected in any of them. The very low incidence of complications in this study, such as those not preventable by a diverting stoma, suggest a very low chance of leakage in low or ultralow anastomosis in patients with rectal cancer and in those who were treated with neoadjuvant radiotherapy.

Author information
Abstract
Primary abdominal tumours attract considerable notice because of their serious prognosis, high cost of treatment and the emotional and psychological trauma. Abdominal tumours can present with pain, vomiting, constipation or less commonly intestinal obstruction. The presentation of cancer in children mimic those of childhood conditions like infections particularly viral infections, urinary tract infections, gastro-oesophageal reflux, malnutrition, constipation, lymphadnenitis, glomerulonephritis and congenital urinary tract anomalies.

Obesity Should Not Prevent from TRAM Flap Breast Reconstruction in Developing Countries.

Alipour S1, Omranipour R2, Akrami R3.
Author information
Abstract
Transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous (TRAM) flap is the most common procedure performed for breast reconstruction after mastectomy for breast cancer. Obesity is a relative contraindication, and complex modifications have been proposed in the pedicled technique for obese patients. We studied ischemic complications in our patients to investigate the effect of body weight on the outcome of TRAM flap breast reconstruction. Pertinent data from medical records of patients receiving a TRAM flap surgery from 1986 to 2011 were extracted. Patients were divided into three groups based on the body mass index (BMI): normal (<25 kg/m(2)), overweight (25-29.9 kg/m(2)), and obese (>30 kg/m(2)). Flap necrosis is defined as any visible nonviable tissue in the reconstructed breast. It was observed that 117 patients had received TRAM flap reconstruction. Fifty-eight patients were excluded. Of the remaining 59 cases, 24 had normal BMI, 21 were overweight, and 14 were obese. No patient was found to develop flap necrosis. Outcome of TRAM flap breast reconstruction in obese patients is similar to nonobese patients. No major necrosis in need of reoperation was identified in the studied obese patients. It was concluded that categorizing obesity as a relative contraindication to TRAM flap breast reconstruction should be revisited based on larger cohort studies.

Intraoperative Frozen Section Evaluation of Sentinel Lymph Nodes in Breast Carcinoma: Single-Institution Indian Experience.

Somashekhar SP1, Naikoo ZA1, Zaveri SS1, Holla S1, Chandra S2, Mishra S2, Parameswaran RV3.
Author information
Abstract
Sentinel lymph node biopsy is an established way of predicting axillary nodal metastasis in early breast cancer. Intraoperative frozen sections (FS) of sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs) can be used to detect metastatic disease, allowing immediate axillary lymph node dissection. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of intraoperative frozen sections in evaluation of sentinel lymph nodes in cases of breast cancer. Between March 2006 and August 2010, a total of 164 patients with clinically node-negative operable breast cancer were subjected to sentinel lymph node biopsy of axillary lymph nodes using preoperative peritumoral injection of radioactive colloid and methylene blue. Intraoperative identification of sentinel nodes was done using a handheld gamma probe and identification of blue-stained nodes. The nodes were sent for frozen section examination. The results of frozen section were compared with the final histopathology. Out of the 164 cases, metastases were detected in SLN by frozen section in 38 cases. There were three false-negative cases (all showing micrometastasis on final histopathology). FS had sensitivity of 92.6 %, specificity of 100 %, and overall accuracy of 98.1 %. The positive predictive value was 100 %, and the negative predictive value was 97.6 %. FS for diagnosis of metastasis of SLNs is reliable. Patients with negative SLNs by the FS diagnosis can avoid reoperation for axillary lymph node dissection. However, FS may fail to detect micrometastases, especially in cases with small tumors.

Abstract
The most effective treatment for thyroid cancer (TC) invading into the larynx and trachea is a complete surgical resection of the tumor, but currently employed techniques are less than ideal. We report a novel surgical technique, which we named Windmill resection and Tetris reconstruction, for patients with TC invading into the laryngeal lumen. We treated eight cases of TC with invasion into the laryngeal lumen by Windmill resection and Tetris reconstruction. We analyzed complications, clinical data, and pathological findings for all patients. Patients included one man and seven women (mean age 69 ± 10 years). Histopathology of TC indicated papillary cancer in five patients, poorly differentiated cancer in one patient, anaplastic cancer in one patient, and squamous cell carcinoma in one patient. Unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve (RLN) palsy was confirmed preoperatively by laryngoscope in four patients, and none had bilateral RLN palsy. All patients underwent Windmill resection and Tetris reconstruction along with total thyroidectomy (three patients), subtotal thyroidectomy (three patients), and lobectomy (two patients). Neck dissection was performed in all patients. The average resected length of the larynx and trachea was 29 ± 6 mm. Air leakage at the suture line occurred in three patients; two required further surgery, while the third was closed by insertion of a Penrose drain. Postoperative RLN palsy occurred in five patients. Aspiration was observed in two patients and resolved within 4 weeks. Pneumonia, atelectasis, and pleural effusion occurred in some patients. No other complications, including hemorrhage, wound infection, or airway stenosis, occurred. There was no postoperative mortality and no recurrence at the anastomotic site. Two patients underwent permanent tracheostomy due to permanent bilateral RLN palsy. Two patients, one with anaplastic cancer and the other with poorly differentiated cancer, recurred 13 and 21 months after surgery, while patients with papillary thyroid cancer had no local recurrence. Importantly, laryngeal functions such as phonation and swallowing were preserved in all patients. This novel surgical technique may be as effective as window resection of the larynx for local control of TC and contributes to the quality of life of patients by resulting in a less unsightly surgical wound.

Abstract
Solitary benign fibrous mesothelioma (BFM) is uncommon and is termed as solitary fibrous mesothelioma or localized fibrous mesothelioma. Although the most common site for its development is the pleural region (65%), it has also been reported in the peritoneum. They are mostly seen in adults (average age: 54 years). Herein, we present a case of BFM in a 2-year-old male child, who presented to our hospital with abdominal pain and a lump in the abdomen. Differential diagnosis included solitary fibrous tumor, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, and benign fibrous lesions of mesentery. Establishing a preoperative diagnosis is difficult on the basis of clinical parameters or imaging studies and final diagnosis can only be assessed based on the results of histopathological and immunohistochemical examination.

Abstract
It has been reported that a leukotriene (LT)-D4 receptor (i.e. cysteinyl LT1 receptor; CysLT1R) has an important role in carcinogenesis. The current study was carried out to assess the possible antitumor effects of montelukast (MON), a CysLT1R antagonist, in a mouse mammary carcinoma model, that is, a solid Ehrlich carcinoma (SEC). Effects of MON on tumor-induced immune dysfunction and the possibility that MON may modulate the antitumor and immunomodulatory effects of doxorubicin (DOX) were also studied. The effects in tumor-bearing hosts of several dosings with MON (10 mg/kg, per os), with and without the added presence of DOX (2 mg/kg, intraperitoneal), were investigated in vivo; end points evaluated included assessment of tumor volume, splenic lymphocyte profiles/functionality, tumor necrosis factor-α content, as well as apoptosis and expression of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) among the tumor cells. The data indicate that MON induced significant antitumor activity against the SEC. MON treatments also significantly mitigated both tumor- and DOX-induced declines in immune parameters assessed here. Moreover, MON led to decreased NF-κB nuclear expression and, in doing so, appeared to chemosensitize these tumor cells to DOX-induced apoptosis.

Abstract
Human adenovirus (HAdV) is one of the most feared infections among immunocompromised patients. In particular, in liver transplant patients, HAdV has been implicated in acute liver failure with resultant mortality. The development of current molecular techniques and surveillance testing protocols have provided tools for early detection of HAdV infection, prior to or at the early onset of HAdV disease. Although reduction in immune suppression is the mainstay of therapy, many researchers have also advocated for early administration of antiviral therapy. In multiple reports, cidofovir treatment has been associated with declines in HAdV viral loads or clinical improvement in solid organ and bone marrow transplant recipients. However, there have also been case reports that raise questions about the effectiveness of antiviral therapy in controlling systemic HAdV disease. We report a case of a 26-month-old male recipient of a liver transplantation for hepatoblastoma who developed adenoviremia with an associated hepatitis and gastroenteritis. He recovered with reduced immune suppression but without antiviral therapy, thus avoiding potential toxicities associated with cidofovir therapy. This case a contrast to previous reports, and it highlights the ambiguity regarding which patients should receive HAdV-specific antiviral therapy. Additional knowledge regarding specific pediatric host factors and HAdV factors that predict poor outcomes are needed. Such information would allow clinicians to better stratify patients by risk at the time of adenoviremia detection so that low-risk patients are not unnecessarily exposed to medications with potential toxicities.

Post-Resection Surveillance in GI Cancers.

Abstract
Recurrence after curative resection of gastrointestinal (GI) cancers is common. Early detection of resectable recurrences may result in a curative resection. In un-resectable recurrences, early detection may improve the quality of life by palliation or with the use of newer chemotherapeutic drugs. The guidelines regarding follow-up of patients after curative resection of GI cancers are from the West which is very different from the Indian population in terms of a disease pattern and social milieu. The guidelines which are commonly used are also not strictly followed. We have proposed in this article the protocols which we follow at our centre after curative resection of GI cancer and how these are different from the guidelines proposed by the West.
